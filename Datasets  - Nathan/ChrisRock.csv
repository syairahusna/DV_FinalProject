kids or people in general would rather hang out with the kid who looks like 
he gets something to eat tjan with kids who are starving as well. Please 
read between the lines of Chris's words and dont take them literally he is 
using what is called satire. You know the same thing that got the french 
newspaper cartoonists killed because back in 1996 things were not as bad as 
they are today so when you see people laughing at these jokes that you say 
are shit it is because times were a lot better than they are today. Thats

a taste and very original approach to humor BUT on this particular STand up 
the audience reactions and his expectation of their reactions was so 
overdone so over the taste and so distracting to the flow that in the end 
of the whole Vid. felt to me like a HUGE series of  One-line-jokes without 
anything even close to his good old flow and tempo... 
   They love him so much and he enjoys it so much that those two together 
makes this genius stand up on much lower grade;
      Basically if he,had option to choose  (in any possible way) to have 
non-overjoyed or maybe better to say ""not exclusively his fan based crowd) 
and more neutral"" audience in general ..
      I mean all audiences which are not total idiots love him; and I am 
sure vast majority of them respects him in most honest way (which ever 
race,or class they are)  but the whole Stand up would be a HUGE difference 
if he would (somehow) menage to organize and  chose mixed and really random 
type of audience,from all walks of life and not only black bunch rooters 
and fans who love him with their hart and every move he make as we could 
see /hear.
   ....
        So I am SURE that with different , more calm and expecting audience 
the whole thing  would not so much and so  humongously taking time from 
show by clapping,yelling, crying and often literally screaming after EVERY 
freaking joke (no matter how funny it is or is it only preparation and 
setting up for next joke, which these people can not under-stand because 
they want their ""god"" to be funny after every sentence...

point.  Cussing goes up in proportion to the untruth in a joke.  It is far 
more efficient a use of the land to farm it than to graze cattle on it. 
 The industry of agriculture that vegetarianism promotes is far more 
efficient at feeding people, and far  more humane (if that word means 
anything).  All his war on drugs humor is perfectly right on, including the 
quip about Jehovah's Witnesses.  Ôªø",1,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Adam K.","It just uses too much resources to raise meat.  70% of the wheat, corn, and 
soy grown in America is fed to lifestock.  If people adopted a more plant 
based diet, we could give that excessive food to starving countries.

Meat also wastes a lot of water.  Less than 1% of the water in the world is 
drinkable.  It takes about 2400 gallons of water to produce 1 pounds of 
beef, and it takes 25 gallons of water to grow 1 pound of beans (veggie 
protein).  Meat also uses 9-11 times for fossil fuel to produce than 
vegetable protein.  Look at the drought in California!

I think if the world is going to increase in population, we have to adopt a 
plant based diet just to protect the environment and to have more food and 
water available for people. 

In nature there are no huge herds of thousands of lion, tigers, etc.. these 
animals are solitary hunters or small pack animals, not in herds of 
thousands like herbivores.  Nature has showed us, as a terrestrial animal, 
if you want to have large numbers, you have to eat mostly plants.

I am not afraid of us destroying the the earth, because the earth has 
survived several cataclysms.  What I am worried about is destroying the 
environment to the point where humans can no longer live.  Cheap meat 
factories also abuse antibiotics, which form resistant strains.  That means 
famine, plague, and drought are possible futures for our descendants if we 
continue this path.

The meek will inherit the earth, carnivores are not meek.  This is why 
2/3'rd of the world is starving.  We eat a wasteful diet.Ôªø",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
