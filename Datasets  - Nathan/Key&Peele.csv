""So what do they do when the 'ignorant' Meccans curse them, taunt them, and 
harass them?
They reply, “Peace be upon you.” They wish their tormentors peace, and in 
so doing they pledge their own nonviolence toward them.
In this phase of the development of the Islamic community, in Mecca, the 
pagans have not yet taken up arms against the Muslims. And the Muslims, in

high turn over rate for a reason. We knew how stupid many of our policies 
were, but the one's you deal with at the checkpoints are the lowest in the 
food chain. In fact, the main reason so many things aren't allowed on 
planes is because of the Airlines, it's called liability. When I worked 
there, our storage areas were so full of tiny ass pocket knives that are 
FSD wanted to start allowing them in, but the Airlines refused. Why? 
Because if a passenger stabbed another passenger, the Airline could be 
liable for it. So it never came to be. Another thing many people don't 
know, politicians don't have to deal with the checkpoints, they get in 
through the exits using their congress/senate badges.﻿","2014-12-12T00:13:06.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports 
came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and 
artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of 
consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's 
been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, 
cynical sense of humor.
In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think 
their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip to be Square"", a song so catchy, most 
people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's 
not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, 
it's also a personal statement about the band itself. TRY GETTING A

It's fine to have your own opinion, but if it doesn't directly affect you, 
then you really shouldn't try to bombard it with hate. If a man loved a 
man, or a woman loved a woman, so what? It might not be your idea of 
natural, but let's face it, humans in general are totally out of bounds 
when it comes to nature. We have defied nature by flying when we are not 
built to fly, we destroy everything we touch, we dominate any other species 
in the world, and for the love of god, we have even left the planet, which 
in all respects, is leaving nature entirely. So please, tell me how two 
people of the same gender loving each other is such an issue? If you don't 
like it, then look away and shut your mouth. You are entitled to your own 
opinion, but that doesn't mean you are allowed to downgrade other human 
beings just because they are different. Love is just love, you guys, and if 
you can't accept that then it's just another thing to add to the list of 
fucked up humanity. ﻿","2014-12-06T03:10:52.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"Key & Peele - Gay Wedding Advice","rtgY1q0J_TQ","Hannibal Zulu","Anal sex is sickening as is anything that involves touching or eating human 
feces. I believe in evolution but some of us aren't evolving. Some of us 
are devolving; many of us in fact. When your mind becomes desensitized to 
the foulness of human excrement then you have devolved to the level of 
chimpanzees and other monkeys that have no problem with touching stool. 
This applies to heterosexuals who engage in anal sex as well as 
homosexuals. It also applies to people who eat chiterlings. Your mind needs 
to be upgraded to a higher level of consciousness where an internal alarm 
goes off when stool and other foul and filthy substances are in the area; 
as is the case for most human beings. The last time I said this to a 
somdomist he told me that they clean themselves thoroughly. I never heard 
of a man who sticks cleaning agents up into his rectum. Even if men are 
dusching now adays, forensic science teaches us that bodily fluids and 
excrement never totally wash away. Also, pleasure and pain have a tendency 
to leave associative imprints on the human psyche. This means that when we 
experience pleasure and pain, whatever else is present or occurs at that 
time becomes associated in our uncounscious minds with pleasure and pain 
for the rest of our lives. Which means that many sodomists (whether 
secretly or publicly) associate stink and stool with pleasure. If I have to 
embrace a mentality like that in order to be accepted by society, then to 
hell with acceptance. I'd rather be a loner and an outcast.﻿","2014-10-23T00:55:26.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Key & Peele - Gay Wedding Advice","rtgY1q0J_TQ","Snouty Pig","Key and Peele are geniuses. This one features terrific guest actors. One of 
the best here is Romany Malco. At the 3:30 mark: 

""Do we th'ow som'thin' other than rice?""
""Like what sir!? What would you throw other than rice!?""
""I 'on' know. I 'on' know... Couscous... Skittles.""

Throughout the skit, Romany Malco can't (or refuses to) make eye contact 
with Gary. It's a little idiosyncrasy that gives credibility to the 
otherwise ridiculous scenario (which Gary points out at the end). Really 
great. Really funny because it plays off the truth.

It's in their culture to be ignorant and bigots. I'm always really caught 
off guard, honestly, when they aren't those things. It's such a rarity.
It's sad to think that we have to wait around that long for gay people and 
women to have their freedom and fairness.

Really. Religious/White people are the real terrorists in our society.
I was religious as a child too but I was so disgusted by the people around 
me that I just couldn't stand it. You guys make everything so difficult for 
everyone else because you believe the world owes you everything and you

"Key & Peele - Gay Wedding Advice","rtgY1q0J_TQ","jenny bardoville","When a person who hates gays arrives at this video, I have to wonder what 
magnetic force drew them uncontrollably here. Then I wonder if they realise 
they create their reality by what they continuously imagine, and that what 
they must have been thinking and imagining is two gay men, in love. Which 
is kinda sweet. But then, I see some of the comments and I realise they're 
not watching the video or listening to the humour in it, so the only 
objective is to spend time hating anything labeled gay. Then I realise that 
they are creating a world of hate to live in, which they must directly 
experience and compound, cos they're thinking and feeling little else. And 
that's really sad. But the sadness must have been there all along. Maybe 
the sadness of wanting to love freely, but seeing all those rules about who 
and how to love, and this from a very early age. They try to love someone, 
but are rejected by the same rules. Maybe even a parent rejects their love. 
Maybe a best friend. Maybe that girl, maybe that boy. And then you see 
those gays, not bloody playing by the rules, how dare they be so free in 
how they love, so free in what rules they live by or don't live by. How 
come they get to do something that even God can't seem to stop? Must be 
frustrating for people who envy gays. Having to see them becoming an 
accepted part of the family. Having to watch them being loved by family 
members. Having to keep hating, keep venom flowing through their veins in 
vain attempts to uphold an unloving society or concepts of an unloving God. 
There is only one Being, we are all it. We are Love. To attempt to 
establish hate in ones heart, is to try to go up against the whole 
universe. Heavy. Let go and get on with creating, through your imagination, 
something loving, something free, something to delight.﻿","2015-02-01T21:32:57.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

stating their ""facts"" about homosexuals automatically based on a bias of ""i 
don't like them so it must be true"" 

a different sexuality is just the difference of what gender the person 
you'll fall in love with might be

you don't see straight people fall in love with the same sex so it makes 
sense the other way around
which also means homosexuality, as well as heterosexuality and other 
sexuality are infact NOT a choice

yes there's some bad examples but that's with all walks of life, there's 
always gonna be bad cases of people in any group that get the most 
attention, it goes for ethnic, religions and even fandoms. 

before someone pulls up religion argument, man is what said it, a mortal, 
not God, and it is said in the bible not the judge or else be judged. 
but if your going to dislike someone, atleast do it because their a 
terrible person with poor choices

with Asperger's. Asperger's is naturally occurring, slightly exaggerated 
version of introversion-a normal human personality spectrum.  Though, 
Asperger's, is neither common enough, nor biologically  adaptive enough to 
the human species to be considered normal. Normal, is not some abstract 
concept, it is a very straightforward word. Normal = Common. It can vary in 
context. Normal in Social context would be anything that is most commonly 
practiced by a society.   Normal in physical context, is any traits that 
are common enough to not curve into two standard deviations beyond a set 
percentage.  1 in 100 people have aspergers. That means people with 
aspergers are abnormal. People thought my behavior was weird. Kids, who had 
NOT been taught to think I was weird, thought I was weird. Get the jist? 
Gays are abnormal, there is nothing morally wrong with being gay. Though if 
Asperger's is listed as a mental health disorder, then i feel discriminated 
that homosexuals can fight to have their abnormality removed because they 
were offended that their mental state was considered abnormal. Being gay is 
not normal. Should they be prosecuted, and denied rights- no! But, don't 
throw those slippery slopes like ""Well, what is normal?"" and ""I was born 
gay, thus I am normal"" and ""How do you define what is normal, everybody is 
different"" Everybody IS different, and not EVERY trait of a person is 
abnormal--just SOME TRAITS--such as Asperger's or Homosexuality. Now

"Key & Peele - Gay Wedding Advice","rtgY1q0J_TQ","the crow","Okay I feel I have to point this out to the people who are debating the 
normality of homosexuality. One homoerotic and homosexual tendencies are 
found in over 450 diffrent species. It is perfectly natural for some humans 
to be gay . Homosexuality isnt anything new it was even normal in most 
society until the rise of Christianity . The only thing unatural is the 
people argueing about what and were someone's genitals should be placed. If 
u are worried about two men engaging in anal sex and or being in a happy 
comited relationship then u are way more unatural and absurd then a gay man 
could ever be. Im a homosexual and have not even the slightest intrest in 
straight sex or relationship even though I was a product of it happening. 
Now since most people who believe homosexuality is wrong have never 
experienced it and usually not accredited scientists psychologists then 
they really have no leg to stand on then there own ignorance intolerance 
and most of all there own stupidity. I applaud key and peele for making a 
video that was both accurate and funny.﻿","2015-01-12T07:31:19.000Z",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

identification--these are the things that most occupy the mind of someone 
who does *NOT* approve of homosexuality (regardless of whatever reason they 
give). It all stems from an underlying un-ease, and preoccupation with 
these issues. Additionally, there's the ignorance thing: some people don't 
understand it, don't want to understand it, and have their minds made up; 
no matter what information comes their way, their attitude will never

take the concept of spiritually and kick it on its ass. Really, I don't

or woman in my presence I would stand in his/her defence or go into a fight 
if it would be necessary. I wathed Brokeback M. and I liked it, I also 
support gay marriages, it doesn`t hurt anybody, and some people can be 
happier so why not? But I remember some time ago, I found an drawing of two 
man cuddling and kissing and my first reaction was being disgusted. I 
wouldn`t say repulsed but I was shocked for a moment. The same way I feel 
when I see a picture of hetero couple pissing on each other, or a hard 
BDSM. Still, some people are turned on by this, and that`s ok. I think some 
people can feel that way. But still, it`s better to save those feelings to 
yourself, not to hurt anybody. After all it`s only your impression, and you

"Key & Peele - Gay Wedding Advice","rtgY1q0J_TQ","NerlockHolmes","what im about to say is NOT to those who are gay or to those who don't 
believe in God. what im going to say is directly to those who want to know 
whether being gay is wrong in terms of being a Christian and to those who 
are Christian yet believe that its okay to be gay. I myself don't follow 
Jesus( I know if I were to die right now id probably go to hell) but I do 
know that he was filled with the holy spirit and this same spirit said 
through Paul( an apostle of Jesus) in Corinthians 6:9-10 ""9 Don’t you 
realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t 
fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or 
commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, 10 or 
are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat 
people—none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God."" he also said in 
verse 12 MSG "" just because something is technically legal(mans laws) 
doesn't mean its spiritually appropriate.""   A lot of Christians like to 
beat down on gays and think that stealing or lying is worse when all these 
sins fall in the same boat. The Christian God loves gay people I mean he 
sent his son to die for them but he doesn't love the ACT of being gay. He 
says he want ALL people to come to him. Christians today should be like 
Jesus and show compassion and kindness towards all whether straight or gay 
but they shouldn't bend the truth of their faith just to be socially 
accepted. You cant just select parts of the bible that you like as truth 
and dismiss other parts. So if a gay person were to die right now would he 
go to hell? yes he indeed would but so would a liar, a thief, a cheat, a 
abusive person, those who lust, disrespectful etc. etc.  Jesus himself ate 
and interacted and showed love to people no matter what they were guilty 
of and he wanted them ALL to follow him but he never bent the truth and 
words he received from his Father so he could be accepted. What im trying 
to say is if you are gay then whatever Im not gonna sit here and argue but 
if you are gay or you want to know what god thinks of gays then know that 
he LOVES them but he doesn't love the act.﻿","2014-11-08T05:56:20.000Z",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Key & Peele - Gay Wedding Advice","rtgY1q0J_TQ","Ismael Rodriguez"," If your opinion on an issue does not follow the main stream's flow of the 
day, you are LABELED a bigot, homophobic, a discriminator. Someone  who's 
negatively against that flow in a harmful way!.You become the ENEMY that 
must be stopped/silenced by any means and at all costs  (legally or 
socially) possible.That does not translate into a democratic thought but to 
a double standard one when assessing two different issues.

Here is a typical response from a Gay activist; ""Bigots (heterosexuals) 
want to deny the rights, to individuals belonging to other groups, to get 
married. Just because they find it offensive/immoral, that is the 
description of a bigot"".

 On one hand X group want to have the right to same sex marriage and on the 
other hand Y group wants to have the right of free speech and free choice 
(church ministers have to comply with the law, even if it goes against 
their religious convictions and  believes).If we don't apply a double 
standard, who is at fault?.

Today the definition and concept of   marriage is been redefine. IF DOUBLE 
STANDARDS ARE BEEN CONSTANTLY APPLIED, democracy (the right of free speech 
and free choice) should also be redefined. It seems like the words 
""bigotry"" and ""homophobic"" are being strategically used (by the Gay 
community, media and the ever supporting government) to gain national 
support and leverage. 

The final objective is to persuade Americans to view Y group has been 
unjust/discriminatory and X group as the victim/righteous. Public opinion 
does matter after all,  AND MORE SO (votes=power and  power=control)) TO 
OUR TRUSTING FRIEND THE USA ""CONGRESS""!.

For obvious reasons, group X  love to play the VICTIM role!. The prevailing 
view on marriage today is ; (1) if  2 people are in love they should have 
the right to get married (2) marriage should be defined and stipulated by 
our government only, based on legal authority (3) all other elements of 
marriage (gender/sex orientation, number of people getting married, ect) 
should be IRRELEVANT!. I for one don't share that view﻿","2014-11-18T20:16:06.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

religion, hip hop culture, the digital age, etc, with some intelligence, 
and yet they and/or their writers can't manage the same level of humor with 
gay & straight issues. This was a funny idea that went on too long, beating 
the same bad punchline.

every single one of us is just Human, we all bleed the same blood, we feel, 
we love and people just need to learn to accept others as they are instead 
of trying to turn people in to something they are not. Just because you do 
not believe in something or how someone was made ok, but seriously you guys 
don't need to abuse each other or put one another down..just remember we 
are in this world for a reason..and it sure as hell aint to pick and bully

session with a gay man. A tv sketch from the US comedy show Key & Peele.

Key & Peele is an American sketch comedy television show. It stars 
Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, both former cast members of MADtv. 
Each episode of the show consists of several pre-taped sketches starring 
the two actors, introduced by Key and Peele in front of a live studio 
audience. The sketches cover a variety of societal topics, often with a 
focus on African-American culture and race relations. Key & Peele won a 
2013 Peabody Awards and was nominated for a 2013 Writers Guild Award.

wrong. Nature is hard to define, and the extent of the power of culture is 
hard to determine. The state of culture effects how we behave. Culture 
directs our inclinations to say the least. A culture in which being gay is 
okay will produce more gay people.Obviously, some aspects of sexuality 
are learned, though sexuality itself is innate. When it comes to accepting 
or not-accepting homosexuality, there's no right or wrong. Its a choice. 
Therefore, while the gay rights movement is marketed as a social 
equality movement, its really just a change in perspective. I only see 
elegance in love between man and woman, but that's my choice. To each their

such thing in the minds of decent people. It’s like giving a chimp a 
drivers licence because he can turn the ignition. Marriage is between man 
and woman who are the only couple according to the laws of nature to have 
sex and produce biological children.

Gay marriage is viewed by God an abomination and will never be passed in 
heaven; only in hell will such a violation of Gods laws prosper.

Homosexuals search to fall in love with a real man, sadly a real man would 
not be a real man if he fell in love with a homosexual. 

Homosexual relationships revolve around lust not love they are statically 
very short affairs, so why oh why do they think by sticking your finger in 
your boyfriends ring is going to make a difference.﻿","2015-02-18T19:51:16.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

You guys are beyond good enough to go independent, even without the

they had released an alternative version out to the public. I feel so 
relieved. Finally, everyone will be able witness the true story being 
unfold and having light shed on this event after so many years of it being 
swept under the rug and covered up with dishonesty. Well yes, now, you 
know.This was actually cut from the original live recording due to the 
horrific nature of its content and producers being under a lot of heat from 
the audience for allowing the clip to be broadcasted. (It was removed 
immediately just hours after airing.) Having taken a lot of criticism and 
numerous amount of death threats, the director's image as a professional 
and visual artist was now being torn apart. His personality completely 
shifted that day. The kind, friendly man the community once knew had 
disappeared. It was as if he was being possessed by some sort of foul 
demonic creature you'd only hear about in an old folk tale or mythological 
legend. He became cold-hearted and mentally illed. The video became an 
obsession. It consumed him. Before being taken away to an insane asylum, he 
was able to create a single copy which he locked away in the Comedy 
Central(CC) vault up until this day. Which was willed to his son before 
passing away in 2014. Now, not a lot of people are aware of this and it 
might creep you the hell out, but I am hopeful that we as a society are 
mature enough to handle the following words I'm about to write. The 
director's mind was not completely lost like they said in the file reports. 
At the end of the clip, you'd noticed how it ended abruptly. It felt like a 
second too early, right? What you don't know is that there were about 2 
minutes of extra footage left behind from the director after everyone ran 
off the set. As he stood, his eyes stared blankly into the lens as he held 
the final note card up towards the camera. I'm afraid i'm not allowed to 
reveal the last sentence of his message for it would jeopardize everything 
and everyone I care about. I apologize. Now, you may be wondering..how can 
I know all this information? Well, you see... It's because

don't like black comedy, that's fine. But why come on YouTube, click on CC 
and click on KnP just to comment, ""I didn't laugh. This wasn't funny."" It 
is clearly one of the best videos they have. Just pause at 2.39. That frame 
alone is golden. If you can't laugh just drift off to whatever it is that 
floats your boat - Garfunkel and Oates, Modern Family, whatever. To each 
his own. 

People be hating on Lion King, Star Wars, Transformers, Ben Affleck, DC, 
Marvel... This is like an era where no one feels validated unless they're 
booing, heckling, downvoting, insult slinging... Geez. I mean, do you feel 
joy when you make people take the effort to tell you to STFU? What is the 
joy in being deliberately provocative?

Why can't we all just... get along? ﻿","2014-11-30T11:18:00.000Z",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

recall raywilliamjohnson reviewed a video about the 1987 Crystal Light 
National Aerobic Championships. The music in this video is actually the 
music that plays in that video. It was a big event hosted by Alan Thicke. 
Anyway, in that championship, one of the competitors learned a family 
member, (I'm not sure exactly what type of family member,) was in an 
accident, presumably a car crash. However, the competitor learned this 
offstage and didn't attack the other competitors. This video was just made 
as a dark twist on that event. So if you want to know the true story, here 
it is.﻿","2015-01-13T16:31:02.000Z",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

the conclusion that peele killed the family. As soon as the director yells 
cut a bunch of police officers and others run on to take down peele. Then 
Key turns to the camera and smiles insidiously. It would also be funny if 
they had like a detective show up and ask questions via large paper, a 
prosecutor and defense attorney show up, a judge to decide the jail 
sentence for peele, peele to rat out other dancers as in on the crime, and 
basically make the whole thing a who-dunnit thing, all the while dancing

because they wouldn't bite them made me feel like they were saying that all 
white people are racist which is racist. So there is no way I would watch

know that it is this day and age because of the purple prostitute. Which is 
Oprah Winfrey. She sits on waters. Illinois is touching the great lakes. 
She has kings that she shares her abomination Gayle King and family are 
kings. The seven heads that calls for wisdom is me. the seven heads are 
seven hills which she sits. the hawaiian islands. She has a place at  the 
top of maui and has her OWN personal road to the waters.  don't count the 
island of Ni’ihau because you need a invitation to go their. there 7 kings 
5 have fallen the 5 kings of Kama one is now Obama which was born in the 
hawaiian Kingdom. Which means not is he president and is a king but he is 
from Hawaii which gives him the throne and 1 to come is the man who bought 
lanai which owns oracle. the 10 horns are 10 reps from apec which was held 
in Hawaii. you will se Oprah’s picture in scarlet and purple stones by 
googling pictures of Oprah in purple and you will see the picture and look

Germany employed a lot of ethnicities from all over the world during the 
war. From India all the way to Africa people came to help. Keep in mind a 
lot of support for Germany came from those who viewed Germany's struggle as 
standing up to the long dominant British Empire - an Empire that had a long 
history of exploiting many people world over. The German racism stuff was 
""mostly"" directed at Jews and Eastern Europeans (read Russians). So its not 
unrealistic to show none Germans in their ranks. You are confusing this 
with American historical racism. Germany even used the KKK as Anti American 
propaganda to show how barbaric Americans are. 

Food for thought.

of mostly muslim Bosnians and a few catholic Croats. Later on Hitler 
proposed to create a Muselmanen-Division (Muslim only division).
Black people were considered Untermensch (Sub-humans), yes, but not subject 
to being exterminated, as the Jews and the Gypsies were. In Rheinland 
(Mainland Germany, for you dummies that don't know shit) blacks were 
forbidden to marry any Aryan (Caucasian German) or to engage in the same 
activities, but outside Rheinland, the blacks were treated just like they 
were in other parts of Europe. Not mentioning that in Africa, the Nazi army 
had divisions full of black people, namely the Free Arabian Legion, a 
branch of the SS of mainly muslims and blacks. You have mostly African 
blacks on the Wermacht, but still, a small number of black Germans, yes,

1. There is a black man in the German Wehrmacht Heer (Army). Did the 
Wehrmacht recruit black men during the Second World War? Just wondering. If 
the Wehrmacht did so, were they from Africa, as the Germans were involved 
in the North Afrika campaigns?

2. Also, the officer narrating his Awesome Hitler Story has SS badges on 
his uniform collar, indicating that he is an SS officer. But SS personnel 
were fanatic in upholding the ideals of the Nazi party, which also included 
racial purity (of Germans, but also whites, I think). It seems weird that 
an SS officer would associate with a black man. I would think SS personnel 
would have harboured hatred not just for Jews, but for blacks as well, 
and...well, anyone not of Aryan descent.

Nazi Germany and they were treated somewhat with respect. They weren't 
allowed to attend college and segregation was in order. Yet, the majority 
of Germans felt sympathy for Africans because their civilization was raised 
in a jungle and they had little education and civil obedience. Although 
there were laws that Africans could not have sex with White Germans because 
Germany believed in racial purity. Blacks don't be offended because Asians, 
Slavics, Jews, and many more races weren't allowed to have sex with White 
Germans either because of their Aryan Laws. So don't discriminate against 
Germans about them all being Nazi's and them hating blacks and killed them 
because they didn't kill blacks and they let Africans work and have a home 
in Nazi Germany with low citizenship.﻿","2015-01-21T18:58:32.000Z",0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0

third wave of Omaha beach who lived because he pretended to be floating 
dead body.  He lived and spent the rest of the war 20 to 60 miles ahead of 
the allied lines doing Nazis in up close and personal.  He had to sort them 
into those he would rather not have killed, those he could careless about 
and those he enjoyed killing very much.  War leads to some really funky 
stuff and funky games of fooling the enemy.  Accomplishing the objective 
and being alive when it is done is an unusual definition of victory but it

How can you have so many different arguments over things that are recorded

There is so much ""false knowledge"" out there today that it's easy for 
retards to get confused I guess.

Why even bother reading any of these comments at all? Maybe comments 
shouldn't exist in general.

No blacks fought as front line soldiers before Korea in the 1950's, until 
then they were only in support roles as mechanics, cooks, drivers or pilots.

Even in Korea it was rare to see a black guy fighting for USA, It took 
Vietnam to get everyone to be seen as equal and black people were accepted 
into any role they were personally capable of fulfilling. 

TL;DR 
Not historically accurate, but
Other than that, it's a fantastic scene, and I don't think anyone could do 
it better!.﻿","2014-10-17T00:21:13.000Z",0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

It might have worked better with Soviet soldiers talking about Stalin and

makes more sense, and the dark skinned SS soldier is a better focal point. 
A dark skinned Soviet soldier is more normal, the USSR was a big place so 
you do miss out on that. The costumer could do a better job too, Soviet 
uniforms are easier to find; those are obviously not period uniforms but

If neonazi, read the following:

Neonazis,( and the only reason that I capitalized that word is because it 
is at the beginning of the sentence) are people, if we can be descent 
enough to label them as such, believe and strive for a society which is not 
only unachievable, but even if achieved would not be able to function at 
all. This by definition makes them idiots,( among all other things) and 
therefore your opinion, along with your argument, is invalid. However if 
you wish to prove yourself wrong, which I hope you do, then pay a visit to 
Germany , where you will ring monstrous ruins of concentration camps 
scattered throughout the whole country. If the number of Jews killed was 
that which you present to us, then surely the nazi regime would not have to 
build so much camps , would they?

You conspiracy theorists are nothing more than underachieving people who 
strive to get attention from the media and the rest of our society. When 
you say that the holocaust has not occurred, you place yourself on par with 
the people who think that we did not land on the moon, or that the 
government is using mind control on us, etc. This goes to show that your 
selfishness is only outmatched by your stupidity, and there no place for 
you amongst Rational society.

"Uncensored - Key & Peele - Georgina and Esther and Satan","a-C9q-Na6_w","Nick Richardson","If someone is an ""atheist"", that is their chose. I would lightly call 
myself one as I don't have any specific beliefs as I like fact. Not 
necessarily science which, as religion, isn't fact. Science is theory as 
religion is more faith or belief. I believe, as more that I hope, that we 
as beings will go somewhere after death and it scares me to think it's all 
darkness. Too much real proof, either witnessed or recorded, suggests the 
possibility of this. I dont care for any religion as some have very dark 
parts to them and some restrict us from pleasures in life. Now I would hope 
that people watching this hilarious video wouldn't take any of it the wrong 
way as its meant as humor as all of Key & Peele is. Especially since most 
of your religion's will somewhere implicate that watching this video, using 
the Internet, and even touching or looking at a computer is wrong. You 
can't take a religion and just follow the certain rules and aspects of that 
you like. Because then that makes you just like us. ""Atheists"", which just 
have their personal morals that dont specifically follow any religion 
(belief). It's Key & Peele. Don't be shocked idiots.﻿","2015-01-04T10:39:56.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Blown away after seeing it the first time. Hadn't watched their stuff in a 
few years and they have definitely improved. I'm still hurting from 
watching that so the least I can do is write few sentences in appreciation. 
The flow of it, timing is perfect, the way it works itself to a fever pitch 
with a comic rhythm, building with every pass, it had me choking before the 
devil came and it never got stupid when they did their signature thing 
riding it until the wheels fall off. This sketch is a comic work of art, 
and I was never a big fan. The choice of words was brilliant , they had me 
thinking it had gone all the way, yet they kept cranking up the volume, 
taking us further out there, getting smarter and raunchier at once. These 
guys kept shoveling coal , steaming straight on through fences and over a 
herd of sheep long after they ran us off the rails.﻿","2014-11-18T03:29:15.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some people are more feminine or masculine than others, regardless of their

the insecurity of the guy in the purple shirt who feels like the other guy 
is homophobic because he doesn't act like him. This happens in all groups 
of minorities, though. Many feminists, blacks, asians, hispanics, and 
homosexuals think everyone who is not in their community is against them, 
but there are MANY who don't think like that. You just don't pay much 
attention to them. Of course, if someone attacks a member of a community, 
they are going to react, but that's to be expected. If you say ""gays are

community, so you know they're all over the schools. Anyways, I have a gay 
friend (well, he's more of an acquaintance since I don't really talk to him 
outside of school). He acts masculine, doesn't USE the annoying high 
pitched girly voice, and dresses like a man, I guess. Anyways, once we were 
having a conversation, I expressed to him my feelings on homosexuality. I 
said I thought it was weird and don't really except it(I'm a christian, so 
since everyone is a sinner, I don't except what a LOT of people do in my 
school, smoking, drinking, premarital sex, etc., so he wasn't exclusive) . 
And you know what? He didn't care. He literally said IDGAF. It didn't 
really affect our relationship too much, cause EVERYONE has differences, 
and he acknowledge that. Everyone you meet in life will not agree with you, 
and that's okay. It's amazing how I have met and seen Jewish & christian 
friends, Jewish & Muslim, and even christian & atheist friends. They know 
they have differences and express them openly, but at the same time they 
don't let that affect their relationship and also can ignore those 
differences in certain situation.
The big problem I have in the gay community is not them being gay, but 
rather they FORCE their beliefs and views on to other. Live and let live. 
Everyone won't agree with you, and you know what? That's perfectly fine. 
But the minute you try to force you're belief system onto others, children, 
and also through television, movies, ads, social media, and everything in

the Current, and what's shown in history, trend with the way that Civil 
Rights and True Equality is going in favor for another set of Minorities. I 
still wonder how it became okay for a Majority to have a Vote or Say in 
what is considered the Rights of a Minority. That's the whole point of 
getting and needing the equal rights, DUH. Because a Minority is being 
unfairly treated by the Majority!! The Majority do not get a Say, since its 
Obviously Biased and Blatantly Not Impartial!! And in the End, has no true 
direct effect on the Majority. Granted there are some shallow and in your 
face Gays out there, but they are not the Template for all Gays. I seem to 
see a lot of people from different groups of people who are obnoxiously 
loud and in your face. They all do it in reaction to the feelings of 
insecurity, fear, and repression they have experience in their lives. Being 
Obnoxious I not owned solely by the LGBTQ community.

 And what is worse in my eyes is the Fact that there are Members of The 
Majority who were or are part of a Minority that was treated poorly, and 
yet go on to continue to treat a different Minority with the same, if not 
worse treatment, then what they received before they got their Equal Legal 
Rights. Homosexuals have been raped, tortured, jailed, harassed, molested, 
beaten, degraded, bullied into silence and suicide, shamed and shunned, and 
Killed for the past 3500 YEARS!! We have earned our Equal Legal Rights that 
the Majority of you supposedly superior Heterosexuals take for granted and 
abuse every fucking day. HYPOCRITES!!

1- We have shown that it is not a Mental Disease but an innate preference, 
since no one can control who they are attracted to, and as long as done 
within the laws of consent and with an informed mind and safe hygiene, as 
all sex should be done, IT HARMS NO ONE!!
2- We proved against the Unnatural argument by proving that it is in fact 
Naturally Occurring as it exists in the Majority of species. (Of course 
that still is not enough for equal rights) 
3- We are successfully continuing to educate and inform the Masses that 
Homosexuality, when Not done illegally or meanly or unsafely or to 
harm, has no effect on if someone is a good or bad person. Since any and 
all sexual acts, when done within the laws of a culture, with respect, 
compassion, and informed safety is acceptable to participate in and has no 
innate input on a persons character or morality!! 

 All sexual practices have the innate potential to hurt, destroy, or pass 
on disease. Even Heterosexuals rape each other, infect each other, can even 
damage each other unknowingly when done with no thought to force and 
strength and positioning. Sex is not by its Nature a limited boxed in 
thing, it is a Force of Nature, meaning it can create or destroy, be 
magnificently potent and intense, or just as intensely devastating and 
destructive. We humans are what put bonds and limits to it, we love to 
label and compartmentalize everything with no regard to its true nature and 
potential!!

 Now we just need to get them to understand that the Books and Scriptures 
of the Three Monotheistic Religions should not be a guide on how to deal 
with and live life as it is Today. Those who wrote it literally had a 
different world and paradigm. We no longer Stone and Kill our disobedient 
family members. We no longer accept forcing sex and marriage on others. We 
no longer allow women to be treated as property. We no longer need, or 
should want to treat others that are different as slaves and property to do 
as we please. That is what the world was like when those books were written 
and truly relevant. We need science and truth and evolution and development 
and harmony with all life forms in order to continue to thrive and survive 
in our world, the World of Today. Those who thing otherwise are brainwashed 
and deluded ignoramuses!

 No one, in this day and age, should continue to allow and follow the input 
from Scriptures from Religions that were created as forms of Governance and 
Control, hidden as a means of an empty Redemption, to dictate your current 
world view. From establishments full of corruption and materialism, lies 
and hypocrisy, and the history of violence and scandal and warmongering and 
dual profiteering!! Wake up sheeple!! There is no Magical Savior waiting in 
the wings to Save us all, We have All we need to save ourselves within us, 
and that is what it will come down to in the end. We must be our own 
Saviors, because when has there EVER been some metaphorical Magic Wand that 
fixed everything, for anyone!! NEVER!! We must become enlightened beyond 
the physical and materialistic, the selfish and self-serving, the delusion 
of separateness in the face of the truth of the united and interdependent

people, I have homosexual friends and they are some the best people I know, 
but when did being a homosexual mean you being overtly flamboyant trying to 
get the whole world to know you're gay? Like some pride parades, what does 
being homosexual have to do with marching around in a tiny thong, there are 
so many gay people who live normal lives like every one else the only 
difference being that they have a same sex partner or are interested in the 
same sex, good for those guys, but in general you can't just walk around in 
public with next to nothing on, yet in the pride parades its completely 
normal?
Maybe it has to do with homosexual people finally being able to live out in 
the open with out fear of stigma (although im sure there is still a lot of 
that) if so, I can understand but being homosexual does not equal being 
overtly flamboyant


Again im an open person and dont want to be ignorant, if someone can

says man should not sleep with man - or something like that (sorry i do not 
go to church or have actually read the bible, so sorry if i got that wrong) 
you may yhink of it as being a sin. But think of this? What if your child 
that is apart of you and that you had loved very much was gay? Would you 
tell them to get the hell out of yoir house and go kill themselfs for who 
they are? Or just go with the flow and tell them whatever makes them happy 
then go for it, and support them. Or even dislike there choice, but still 
love your child and let them be who they are?.
Would you rather a person kill themselfs, when they have not yet have 
experienced life for who they are? It is not a choice to be gay or 
bisexual, but who you are really. Now imagine if you were in there shoes? 
How would you feel if your mother or father or anyone hurt you nearly every 
single day for being who hou are? Yes there are people lile that in the 
world. But do theu honetly deserve it? Being beaten down, beimg called a 
nussiance to the world. Think about that...tjink about how you treat 
others, treat people how you want to ne treated and not desrroy others 
happiness. So for those religious people out there, if you dont like 
peoples sexual orientation, then keep yoir mouths shut and be nice to them 
at least, dont be selfish.

copulate and produce offspring the child is a result of both the parents 
DNA, if the parents are not born again the child will be born with the sins 
of their family tree passed down because their parents are a result of 
carnal nature.

If your'e grandfather was a closet homosexual it could be passed down to 
you and will be prevalent in your carnal nature but it can be overcome, 
look at the world, look at animals, homosexuality is not natural, female 
was created for male and male for female that's why gays cannot produce 
offspring, but it is a sign of the times and a sign of who is in power of

community, so you know they're all over the schools. Anyways, I have a gay 
friend (well, he's more of an acquaintance since I don't really talk to him 
outside of school). He acts masculine, doesn't USE the annoying high 
pitched girly voice, and dresses like a man, I guess. Anyways, once we were 
having a conversation, I expressed to him my feelings on homosexuality. I 
said I thought it was weird and don't really except it(I'm a christian, so 
since everyone is a sinner, I don't except what a LOT of people do in my 
school, smoking, drinking, premarital sex, etc., so he wasn't exclusive) . 
And you know what? He didn't care. He literally said IDGAF. It didn't 
really affect our relationship too much, cause EVERYONE has differences, 
and he acknowledge that. Everyone you meet in life will not agree with you, 
and that's okay. It's amazing how I have met and seen Jewish & christian 
friends, Jewish & Muslim, and even christian & atheist friends. They know 
they have differences and express them openly, but at the same time they 
don't let that affect their relationship and also can ignore those 
differences in certain situation.
The big problem I have in the gay community is not them being gay, but 
rather they FORCE their beliefs and views on to other. Live and let live. 
Everyone won't agree with you, and you know what? That's perfectly fine. 
But the minute you try to force you're belief system onto others, children, 
and also through television, movies, ads, social media, and everything in 
society in general, they aren't the bad one, YOU ARE.﻿","2015-04-25T21:35:21.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

who persecute homosexual people are wrong, and sinning, as it is not our 
job as human beings to judge other peoples life styles. The Bible warns us 
not to participate in such actions. BUT, no where in the Bible does it tell 
us to slander the names of homosexuals. Id like to make this clear to those 
who do not see... most Christians could not care less about the sexual 
orientations of human beings. the problem they have is that the homosexual 
community is throwing a fit because we simply do not condone those actions. 
yet the homosexual community does not condone any belief that is not in 
their favor. As a Christian, I do not care about a persons sexual 
orientation, to be honest, i dont even need to know about it, I will still 
be your friend, and treat you as a human being. but dont ask me to support 
your life style, if you dont support my Christian lifestyle. please

"Key & Peele - Office Homophobe","e3h6es6zh1c","Loudlightning3","I heard that the pervertedness of gay people caused aids to form. Not what 
I think, but it sounds believable I guess... How do men actually get 
aroused to other men anyways? Do they imagine taking it in the ass or 
something? It makes no sense to me, its gotta be a choice. From the 
perspective of a straight man, I think its totally reasonable to assume 
that every man is straight by default and then somewhere down the line 
because of some weirdos getting together and fucking each other suddenly 
the choice of doing another man was acceptable for the rest of their 
lives... maybe the idea caught on? I guess they decided that they liked 
getting drilled by another man to be more enjoyable... its kinda strange to 
think about. I can't imagine a man just being born and naturally thinking 
about getting drilled in the ass. Is that what really happens?﻿","2014-10-20T06:43:51.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Key & Peele - Office Homophobe","e3h6es6zh1c","TheGameKeeper94","Liked the joke. At first, I thought it was a joke on homosexuals that slap 
the homophobe term on anyone that just thinks otherwise, like in comment 
sections here on YouTube, whenever I speak my opinion on the matter, being 
all for Gay Marriage, but questioning a few things, such as why would a man 
want to be with another man, homosexuality being taught in schools(which I 
still question), or saying that homosexuals really should keep their 
personal lives to themselves instead of letting the world know(which they 
should), I get called a homophobe, just for speaking my opinion. Heck, when 
Michael Sam was released, people were calling The Rams homophobes, thinking 
they released him just because he's a homosexual, when in reality, he was 
released along with a few others because of roster cuts. He's with the 
Dallas Cowboys now. Those homosexuals really don't know what phobia means, 
its a fear of something, such as arachnophobia, fear of spiders. Just 
because some people have a different opinion on homosexuality(including the 
religious nutjobs), doesn't mean they have a fear of homosexuals. That's 
like saying I have a fear of CoD, because I hate how the games have been 
the same every year.

Then the little twist comes in at the where the guy is actually a 
homosexual, but isn't announcing it like the other guy is. Liked the twist 
on the joke, I thought the other guy was straight.﻿","2014-09-17T00:15:29.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

related. You can have a masculine gay man and a feminine gay man, you can 
have masculine straight men and feminine straight men. It's got nothing to 
do with sexuality, it's just part of your personality and expression. It's 
the same with straight women and gay women, and everything in between.
""Gender and sexuality. . . are two different things, combined in many 
different ways. If you mismatch your socks, you understand.""

I mean, lots of gay people think that vagina's, or a man fucking a woman is 
disgusting.
Okay, you're gay... You don't have to shove it in everyone's face and even 
organise clubs and send people to go to schools to tell stories about how 
gay you are and you like fucking men.
And people act like straight people don't get bulied. People find all kinds 
of reasons to bully someone,

comedy like they always do. Then I scrolled down to the comments. . . ""I 
hate it when gay guys act like this and flaunt their sexuality!"" Really?

Of course! Let's ignore all the straight people who cat call, and comment, 
""Dayumm that girl got a fine ass."" You know, shit you see on a normal daily 
basis. But god forbid a gay guy does it and he's playing a horrible 
stereotype. Straight people? Get over it. Gay people? Get over it. There 
are guys who act like the one in pink, and there are guys who act like the 
one in white. It doesn't matter which is more prominent, because the 
experience differs between individuals. You may experience more of the pink 
shirt, but I've experience more of the white shirt-

In fact, the most flamboyant guys I meet are actually straight! Shocker, 
right?! The point this video was trying to make is that not ALL gays act 
like the one in pink. It's not focusing on the SOME or the MOST. It's just 
making a statement. While also being comedic. Seriously, lighten the fuck

"Key & Peele - Office Homophobe","e3h6es6zh1c","WearYourRuinsWell","As a gay man, I found this funny yet insulting. I'm all for having a good 
laugh but when it's something along the lines of this video, it puts gay 
men down. Was his behavior work place appreciate? No. But I can recall 
countless times of straight male coworkers giving explicit details of their 
sexual activity and their bodies. Personally, this kind of subject matter 
does not bother me at all. I'm a very open minded person and not much 
(anything that is consensual between persons that are of legal age and 
sound mind) bothers me when someone goes on about their sexual endeavors. 
Of course this is a satire but it does suggest that gay men should present 
themselves as ""non flamboyant"" or ""straight suggestive"" because being open 
about your sexuality could be taken as ""pushing your lifestyle down 
someone's throat."" Again, I like to mention that although this wasn't 
literally said, it suggests that being an openly gay man(who's flamboyant) 
makes them an asshole due to their openness possibly being taken as 
""shoving their lifestyle down someone's throat."" This is not the kind of 
comedy the lgbt community needs right now due to the fact that we are not 
treated equally (along with anyone else who isn't a well off, straight, 
white male). It's just giving more fuel to people who don't treat others 
equally or think of others as lesser humans and continue their behavior. 
The behavior I'm speaking of is the kind of behavior that gets people 
harassed, bullied, tortured and often killed. If we lived in a society of 
humans that treated everyone equally and respected everyone equally this 
would be hilarious. Unfortunately, we do not live in that world. So this 
kind of satire is not appropriate and is not how the gay community should 
be viewed. All it does it allow for stigma to continue. It may seem as 
though this is an over reaction but small hidden things like this video put 
us in trouble for the long run. To closex I would just like to thank anyone 
who actually read this and give it some food for thought. I appreciate you

with other local gay men in my area, which is pretty ""conservative"" 
fundi-republican based. I try to explain the importance of showing up at 
the voting booths, and asserting yourself in the local community groups 
that assist seniors and food banks, but all many of them want to do is get 
drunk, wave rainbow flags, and act immature. Consequently, when I go to 
LGBT events in the nearest larger city, with a much more inclusive and 
slightly liberal vibe, a much greater number of the gay men I interact with 
resemble the professional guy depicted in the video. I think that harsh 
non-inclusive environments have a profound effect on the LGBT community. 
Heteros help fuel the behaviors that lead to gay male stereotypes just as 
much as gay men...﻿","2015-01-13T09:16:19.000Z",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

1950
- Why are we punished just for being gay? It's not like it hurts anybody! 
Just let us live our lives!
- Well OK, fair point. 

1965
- Why are we labelled as mentally ill? We feel fine and we don't pose any 
danger to anyone! Just let us live our lives!
- Well OK, fair point.

1990
- Why aren't we allowed to have our relationship recognized by the law? It 
would make our lives so much easier!
- Well OK, if that's gonna make you happy.

2000
- We should have the right to get married like straight people do!
- I don't know, the institution of marriage has it place and function in 
society, and thousands of years of history so I have some doubts if it's a 
good idea....
- Why do you hate us? Are you a nazi?
- What? I don't hate you! I just think...
- You shouldn't think that! It's homophibic and hateful!
- Well OK, fine. I guess it won't do any harm... 

2010
- The law should prohibit to refuse to make buisness with us just beause 
we're gay!
- Now hold it, that's just basic freedom of contract. Nobody has an 
obligation to make any deals with anybody. 
- Why do you hate us so much? You homophobic nazi intolerant bastard!
- I don't hate you! I just think your political demands are going a bit too 
far.
- You're a homophobe, you are sick from your hatred towards gay people!
- Well OK, fine... 

2015
- Not accepting our lifestyle and our political demands should be 
considered a hate crime!
- What? Are you crazy? You're wanna punish people for their views now? 
- Why do you hate us? Are you a nazi?
- I don't hate you, I just...
- You're a homophobe! You should be forcibly treated for your hatered! 
- No I'm not a homophobe. As the matter of fact you're starting to sound 
pretty fascist right now!
- We're fascists! Look who's talking! A hateful homophobe who refuses to us 
our basic human rights dares to call us fascists!
- I didn't ever refused you any human rights...
- Except for now!
- Well OK, fine...

This right here is why we are hated, because of some of the LGBT community 
act like total pricks to straight people.
You like the same gender, grow up and be mature about it, the person you 
are attacking and profiling as a homophobe is probably more okay with it 
than you are.
I think it comes from those who are still uncomfertable with their 
sexuality, so they attack straight people.  The same mentality as high

often like to play the race card but most of the time its cuz the Black 
person is being a jackass. This is also the reason why many people who hate 
Black people hate Black people. Educated and wealthy Blacks are among the 
nicest people I've ever know though but the point I'm making is that people 
don't hate you cuz you're Black, they hate you cuz you're a jackass.

Yes, I'm saying Blacks tend to more likely be a jackass then other ethnic 
groups in America, regardless why that may be. You meet a lot of jackass 
White people too but thats cuz there's just so many Whites in this country.﻿","2014-12-11T08:24:29.000Z",0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0

"Key & Peele - Office Homophobe","e3h6es6zh1c","TLI-Inferno","To all the comments saying ""(Insert gay or straight) people aren't like 
(this), they're like (that)"", positive stereotyping of your own group is no 
less ignorant than negative stereotyping of someone else's.

The truth is there are nice people and assholes all over the place.  There 
are plenty of straight people who express their ignorant dislike of 
homosexuals.  There are plenty of straight people who don't really care 
what other people do in their bedrooms in the first place.  There are 
plenty of straight people who support equality for homosexuals.  There are 
plenty of gay people who are flamboyant and obnoxious, those are the ones 
most people notice.  Then there are plenty of gay people who are just like 
anyone else, except gay.  Those are the ones people don't notice, and just 
assume are straight because it never came up.

No group of people are all the same.  As long as you keep trying to figure 
out what a group of people is like, you'll always be wrong about the 
majority of the people in that group.

Personally, I'm in the group of straight people who think gay people should 
not be discriminated against, but I also believe that sexuality should not 
be obnoxiously expressed in public or in the professional environment, and 
I'm sick of people who talk about penis all the time and call anyone who 
asks them to stop a homophobe.  If a guy was in a public place surrounded 
by children and talking about fucking his girlfriend in the ass, people 
would immediately try to quiet him and get him out of the area.  If a 
homosexual talks about fucking a guy in the ass in public surrounded by 
children, he can point fingers calling people homophobes and actually 
manage to stay there for a while.  Granted, there will probably be 
arguments, but most people would refrain from stopping him lest they be 
accused of hating gay people.

Kind of like when there's a rude black person in a restaurant; white people 
have to just sit there and endure it, or else be accused of being a racist; 
they have to wait for another black person to ask the person to shut the 
hell up.

This sort of reverse discrimination is taking place against pretty much any 
group of people that share a characteristic of the stereotypical american: 
A white, christian, straight male.  Obviously this image needs to change 
and people need to be equal, but oppressing other groups of people just to 
elevate yourself will never bring about equality.  Discrimination of any 
sort is still discrimination, there is no justification for it.﻿","2014-11-03T05:19:18.000Z",0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0

"Key & Peele - Office Homophobe","e3h6es6zh1c","Joe D'Alonzo","   Catholics never says gay people can't get married. It says they can't 
get married THROUGH THE CHURCH. 
Think of the church as an institution, like a bank. Say the bank has a 
minimum balance of $2000, but some people don't like that because they only 
have $1500. Are they supposed to pester the banks and let them make a bank 
account? No! Since they don't apply to the terms, they can go to another 
bank with a lower minimum balance. In the same way gays do not apply for 
marriage through the church, since it is a sacrament for a MAN AND WOMAN. 
Gay people fighting for this sacrament is like a healthy 20 year old guy 
asking for the sacrament of the anointing of the sick. He doesn't apply so 
he shouldn't receive the sacrament, but somehow when it comes to gay people 
getting married through the church it becomes discrimination. Gay people 
can still get married legally through the government and the church doesn't 
judge. Many people within the church get married through the government 
anyways ex. a Catholic and Jewish couple.
   In the Bible it says if men lay with men it is a sin, not being gay 
itself. It is a challenge gay people have to face, trying to resist that 
urge. Many will say ""Yeah, but they're born gay how could they go through 
their lives without sex? How can it be a sin? Its unfair!"" Think about 
priests. They can't have sex! And what about other peoples' challenges in 
life? People born with no arms and legs, people with autism; Is it fair? Of 
course not! Some people have more of a burden to bare than others but God 
gives you challenges in life you have to face. Some are greater than 
others, but they are given to those who are capable of handling them. The 
stronger are given a heavier cross. In the end we all sin and if gay guys 
sleep together, as long as they repent and acknowledge they made a mistake 
they will not go to hell. 
  I love how many people are out there bashing the Catholic faith when they 
themselves don't go to church every Sunday and aren't even educated about 
the faith. Just because gay people don't apply for marriage within the 
church and sleeping with the same sex is a sin, doesn't mean the church 
discriminates against gay people. In the end we are all sinners and a 
sinners are welcomed to participate in church and God will forgive us all 
if we repent.﻿","2014-10-28T21:36:21.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

symbolizes its ""UNIVERSE"". Its what they pay the utmost attention on their 
body its their central console if you will and in the meantime is their 
strong point and weak point. And they want to satisfy it above all else.

And on that context, gays, they have a MULTIVERSE. They love their dicks so 
much that their love overflows and goes beyond control, to other dicks, to 
fulfill their ego. Subsequently leaves us to a conclusion that gays are 
NARCISSISTIC DICK-WISE. They want ALL the dicks out there. While still in 
that cloud of confusion they just turn their asses and make the other 
person stick it in a wrong hole, which is not intended for that purpose 
which makes it even more confusing.

On the other hand PUSSY is our beloved weak spot. It is our Kryptonite. 
Pussy is the BLACKHOLE where all our pride ends up. It draws us in and its 
so hard to PULL back. 

Pussy is the beginning and the end of our existence.

Pussy is love, pussy is life.

laughing(mainly black ppl) however the kicker is he's not laughing, he's 
just doing the gestures. 
Ps. It's seems like I have to do this for most of their vids because ppl in 
the comment sections are to daft to understand their comedy which stems 
from observational, satirical, black(dark) comedy, and of course slapstick.

funny about it. 1) Look at the title of that skit and every other skit of 
their show 2) The jokes are unique so this skit the guy is having a seizure 
cause he's holding in his laugh as you can see.Simple as ABC.Your seeing 
what everybody else is watching 3) They go so far that everybody bleeds out 
their ears when his laugh sounds like a crazy screech. So they have humor

down on his beard, and then four dudes with a frisbee.  Despite how easily 
he dealt with the others, the main villain is always his equal, yup, this 
is late 80's to early 90's action movie at its finest.  Reminds me of a lot 
of Norris, Segal, and van Damme movies.

Hang on a second, he broke that guys neck with the back of his head.  This 
was like combining Segal action movies with the Chuck Norris meme.

aluminum and even a lot of things useful. Now there are cities where there 
are high-rise buildings, kindergartens, hot water and hospitals. Now, there 
may not be sold women for a bundle of sable skins as it was before the 
Russian. I occupied the Baltic states. Built there factories and power 
plants. Instead of funny farms. Baltic States do upscale radio equipment 
and cars, famous perfume and balms. I was asked to leave from there. Now 
there is mined sprats, and most of the working population with clean 
evrounitazy. I invaded Central Asia. Built a channel, plants, space 
centers, hospitals and stadiums. There were building space rockets and 
aircraft, oil and gas and chemical equipment, mined copper, oil and gold, 
grew wheat and cotton for the whole country. I was asked to leave from 
there. Now there is mined American loans to grow hemp and opium poppy, and 
half of working-age population went to work as street cleaners or on 
construction sites of the former occupants. I occupied the Ukraine. And 
there I also built factories and power plants, bridges, factories, mines 
and universities. Ukraine is making aircraft engines, ships, tanks and 
cars. I was asked to leave from there. Now they produce Maidan in 
commercial quantities. And most do not fucking make it, but we are 
confident that Europe is waiting for them with open arms. And yet you know 
what? I'm sick of apologizing for what I occupant. Yes, I occupant. 
Birthright. The device Kalashnikov I know better than the device nipples 
for milk. I aggressor and bloodthirsty monster. Be afraid. It is 300 years 
I lived under the Mongols - but where are now those of the Mongol-Tatars? I 
burned it to Moscow, so as not to give it to Napoleon Bonaparte - but 
finished Bonaparte? This I sat in a trench at Volokolamsk, in Stalingrad 
and burned in a tank at Kursk, realizing that the Germans keep incredibly 
difficult, almost impossible, but in a different way just - where today 
those Germans where they fucking Hitler? I occupier, but in civilized 
Europe knew nothing about it, so it came home to me all and sundry. Turks, 
British, Poles, Germans, French .... Land enough for all - by 2.5 meters 
each. Americans are afraid of the truth coming, hope for the rocket and the 
fifth column, but for them we have a lot of land - enough for everyone in 
abundance. I was, is and will be the Russian invaders - I do not need 
someone else, but my I never will not give it. I do not need your 
hypocritical ""freedom"" - the freedom of being a man. To be a man, I do not 
need your rotten democracy of capitalism, two-faced alien to me your ideas 
and everything that you call the Western ""values"" - perversions, vices, 
deceit and endless greed. I have other interests. Russian man more 
interested in space, education, medicine, science and development of 
creative abilities of each person. Russian people like to create. Politely 
warn you for the last time! Do not stand in my way - I build the world, I 
love the world, but I know how to fight the best.
Sincerely, Russian invaders.

"Barack Obama Brings Key & Peele ""Anger Translator"" 2015 White House Correspondents' Dinner!","xImPwjdvw8U","ProSecondAmendment","This is a satanic mockery by the antiChrist himself. Obama you are a NOT a 
natural born citizen of America. You are a foreigner of this land and have 
violated the laws of this land. You are a terrorist at the highest level 
and You are NOT my president. In fact, you are NOBODY'S president. Soon you 
will be revealed for who you really are. Yahushua Hamahshiach aka Jesus 
Christ has already defeated you for eternity! Glory and praises to the one 
and only True living God. His blood covers those who confess with their 
mouth and believe in their heart that Yahushua is the only begotten son of 
the most High God!

Notice the way this demon led ""Translator"" holds his hands giving honor to 
satan. People of this world PLEASE WAKE UP AND NEVER LAUGH AT ANYTHING 
THESE PEOPLE SAY FOR THEIR COMEDY IS NOTHING BUT MOCKERY TO YOUR DEATH. 
These are wicked people and I pray that the eyes who see this video 
understand these are things that should never be mocked or joked about. 
Satan does this to cover up his tracks on all the death he causes because 
he can't get glory if people are seeing his true colors. You can see the 
evil on Obama's face. He knows  the majority of the world see's how evil he 
is, yet he has to make fun of the truth even when people see right through 
it, for if he hesitates one second he loses power. Little does he realize, 
he's already losing power no matter what. But he will keep doing evil no 
matter what people say or do until he is stopped and arrested.﻿","2015-04-26T23:10:47.000Z",1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

Jimmy's goals was to become a teacher, so he becomes one that reflects his 
humorous and fun-loving nature, and because he finds his niche in life, he 
eventually matures and mellows out.  In other words, he becomes Mr. Fryer

experiences such severe mental and behavioral deterioration that he becomes 
like a babbling child again, so completely in fact that the courts see fit 
to place him in a special education class, one with a teacher whose 
patience and laid-back attitude would be best suited to handle his abnormal 
behavior.  In other words, he becomes Jimmy.  This continues on for

to shreds by some classes...  I will never understand why the US (or at 
least california) does not let teachers punish children.  It isn't like the 
parents are doing jack crap in terms of raising their kids anyway.  No one 
is perfect, but holy crap did most of my peers piss me off with how 
childish they were, even as juniors/seniors. 

I don't care if some people would abuse it, I sometimes wonder how much 
calmer and how much more kids would learn if they had the fear of a leather 
belt coming their way if they acted like complete dickwads.. apparently 
civilization has not only survived with such practices but has thrived and 
pushed kids to succeed.  Granted, I am not advocating abuse, but teachers 
in california literally are not able to do more than call in security to 
have someone escorted to the principle, only to be suspended for 2-3 days 
(which is what they want anyway).  There were days where a third of the 
class was suspended and the end of the week was so hectic because the 
teacher was basically compelled to go over everything AGAIN which was a 
complete waste of time for those of us who actually respected our elders. ﻿","2015-04-01T18:38:02.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Key And Peele - Substitute Teacher 4","FcV2mNynZnk","Joshua Raphael","There are a lot of comments saying that students should behave in class, my 
big question is why? I think back to when I was 13-17 and I am not suprised 
that I was a disruptive and an annoying student at times. I was never told 
why what I was learning was revelevant. Any time I would ask ""why do I need 
to learn this,"" ""When will I need this in my life"" I pretty much told to 
sit down and shut up. I then thought to myself ""if they can't explain to 
why I need to learn what their teaching why should I learn it""?

Now that I am older I understand the relevance of what was being taught in 
school but if you don't show  13 year old boys how the math that they are 
doing interacts with the world around them, you are going to get a good 
level of disengagement. ""Sit down and Shut up,"" is a poor form of teaching. 
If you can't justify what you are teaching it has no business being taught 
in the curriculum.

If highschools taught what was necessary cut down on ""electives"" that you 
are forced to take, students would be done by sophmore year (in the States) 
and Grade 10 in Canada, then we could actually begin to become contributing 
citzens much sooner.﻿","2015-04-21T18:31:16.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

to raise him, whilst serving as both a father and mother figure, thereby 
explaining the father's effeminate and motherly behavior.﻿","2014-11-17T20:12:48.000Z",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

up with football, but this was hilarious to me. I mean... Sherman's 
mannerisms, like he REEAAAALLY wants to remind us that he's an intellectual 
black, from Stanford, without explicitly saying it, were on point. They 
just could've been more creative with Lynch. I guess this was before the 
presser where he basically said ""Why the fuck are y'all still trying to 
interview me?... Take a hint!"". He isn't stupid. He just doesn't want to be 
bothered.﻿","2015-02-01T15:08:35.000Z",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

are known to be very metaphorical through their skits, bringing up several 
topics such as economic inequality, racial profiling and several other 
political matters. I think it's fair to say the two have constructed an 
easy outlet/platform for their opinions to be represented in a manner that 
isn't aggressively blatant and also allows for the viewer to create their 
own opinions based on their interpretation. That's the way I see the Key & 
Peele skits. For this particular one I see a press conference full of 
individuals sitting on the edge of their seats and lingering on every 
single word the two are conjuring up. I interpret it as how so many people 
in our culture and our society hold the words of the most talked about 
celebrity or figure, so closely, no matter how unrelated to them personally 
those words being spoken may be... But I could be totally wrong, it's an 
interpretation, one of many I'm sure. Seeing as these two are comedians, 
I'm not necessarily saying that for the message you should give up the 
laugh but I do think one can come out watching this with something 
gained... ﻿","2015-02-02T05:57:38.000Z",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

point out that for those of you wondering, Bennett Miller directed 
Moneyball and Capote, so he has more connections to the Academy than 
DuVernay. He just has more experience in Hollywood, where DuVernay is 
relatively new to the directing business. It indeed isn't fair that the 
Academy is more likely to vote for who they know, but Duvernay was not

happening so people can see it to day and it is nothing freaky.  you know 
that it is this day and age because of the purple prostitute. Which is 
Oprah Winfrey. She sits on waters. Illinois is touching the great lakes. 
She has kings that she shares her abomination Gayle King and family are 
kings. The seven heads that calls for wisdom is me. the seven heads are 
seven hills which she sits. the hawaiian islands. She has a place at  the 
top of maui and has her OWN personal road to the waters.  don't count the 
island of Ni’ihau because you need a invitation to go their. there 7 kings 
5 have fallen the 5 kings of Kama one is now Obama which was born in the 
hawaiian Kingdom. Which means not is he president and is a king but he is 
from Hawaii which gives him the throne and 1 to come is the man who bought 
lanai which owns oracle. the 10 horns are 10 reps from apec which was held 
in Hawaii. you will se Oprah’s picture in scarlet and purple stones by 
googling pictures of Oprah in purple and you will see the picture and look 
at purple prostitute from me at youtube. Yes I AM sent from God to tell you 
that when my numbers increase the antichrist, the beast, the number 666,

BEINGS LOVE TO LAUGH, AND THE AVERAGE ADULT LAUGHS 17 TIMES A DAY. HUMANS 
LOVE TO LAUGH SO MUCH THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY INDUSTRIES BUILT AROUND

does over-emphasize things so that the viewer knows that he is Stanford 
educated/ not stupid. The Lynch impression wasn't bad because that's how 
Lynch does it; he'll pick a phrase and just stick with it. They could've 
done with Lynch and found a line that would've been funnier, but ultimately

Chlorine is in the halogen group (17) and is the second lightest halogen 
following fluorine. The element is a yellow-green gas under standard 
conditions, where it forms diatomic molecules. Chlorine has the highest 
electron affinity and the third highest electronegativity of all the 
reactive elements. For this reason, chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent. 
Free chlorine is rare on Earth, and is usually a result of direct or

"Key & Peele - Quarterback Concussion","cJ4tlOIo4A8","Prentice Sherrod","Its a comical skit but there is fact in it. I don't think football will be 
around for long. It could be years from now but eventually this country is 
going to have to come to a realization of the effects that sport has on 
people's health. Head trauma is an all too common reality in the NFL. Along 
with debilitating injuries that compound over their career.. I don't blame 
parents who don't allow their kids to play. After 18 years of playing in 
school, 4 years in college their bodies are already half way demolished.. 
Then they are rewarded with a few more years, making six figures to destroy 
themselves even further.. And you're going to need as much money as 
possible because the medical bills you're going to have to pay is going to 
deplete much of your savings.﻿","2014-10-17T13:11:48.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

USA has more prisons then universities and schools.
The education system in the US is extremly bad, only the privat schools are 
good. All the public schools are terrible. 
Most ppl from USA are poor. 
Living quality in USA is below most countries in Europe and Asia.
Just a few % are rich and all the others are poor... 
Rich ppl can do what they want, and poor ppl are fcked.

USA is pretty much a jewish experiment anyways... :)

although this is a really funny skit, it can be read into more deeply. Also 
it's amazing to me how many people believe that action should be taken 
towards football to lessen injuries and head trauma but as a former high 
school football player and now moving on to college to play ball I really 
don't want football as I know it to be changed or taken away from me, 
injuries and even death is a risk that only the players and those close to 
the players understand and accept. I would compare it to the military but 
that would degrade the courage and honor of the armed forces, so I'll say 
it like this, just as a soldier has the passion to protect his nation and 
accepts that that he/she may die, a athlete has a passion for his/her sport 
and accepts the chances of death or injury. Obviously those in the military 
are held in higher regard than athletes but I believe we share a similar 
spirit.  ﻿","2014-12-16T14:04:46.000Z",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

just because you dont wear pads in rugby doesn't make it more manly in 
football you honestly get hit alot harder because the guy has pads on it 
gets rid of a mental mind barrier at least for some rugby honestly makes 
you alot more tired you run the entire time and give and get hits overall

They were pretty much saying that no matter how stupid and ridiculous your 
artwork is, you can slap a couple of words or even a story behind it and 
SOMEONE is going buy into it and praise it for being so ""deep"" and 
""thought-provoking"". I know this from personal experience, I used to attend 
an art college.

For example, there was a student in one of my art classes who did a 
performance piece in which he slammed a chair on the floor for 10 minutes 
straight. I kid you not, that was the only thing he did for 10 minutes. 
After he finished, the student said ""I wanted to capture the vicious 
turmoil that rages in society today."" My teacher along with the entire 
class erupted in applause.  I'm thinking to myself ""Am I missing something 
here, all I saw was a chair being slammed continuously on the floor for 10 
straight minutes. Maybe I'm crazy.""

Anyways, just thought I'd share that to anyone who was confused about this 
skit. Props to Key and Peele for doing this.﻿","2014-12-04T22:48:00.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Key & Peele - Dicknanigans","xdXo8uJ9NSk","Tama Semo","Arguably a portrayal of an oppositional allusion  to T, S, Eliots Modernist 
masterpiece ""The Waste Land"", the experimental theatrical piece 
""Dicknanigans"" is an avant-garde play regarding the implications of a 
dissolution of societal norms. 
Furthermore, ""Dicknanigans""  not only portrays the primitive savageness 
that lies within us all but also the storminess and verisimilitude of 
passion. The divisiveness of the ephemeral progression of the play acts a 
metaphor to Shakespeare's ""Measure for Measure"" as the macabre, fleeting 
nature of life is examined. In addition, the references to both 
Shakespeare's and Eliots works are in fact a juxtaposition of how figures 
can contribute to the culture of Western Society and analyze the growing 
barrenness/fragmentation of it. The violence is a satirical observation of 
the growing restlessness of the millennial generation and is a 
comment about how both pain and progress go hand in hand within our world. 
The repetition of violence and ""Dicknanigans"" link violence, sexuality and 
passion with one another to bring long harbored internal strife within our 
society to the surface. The cognizance portrayed within this play is an 
abstract view on realism; said cognizance is a hard counter to the 
existential despair and nihilism within modern society and the exquisite 
eucatastrophe is a refreshing and long overdue conclusion on the human 
condition.﻿","2015-01-14T23:58:04.000Z",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

into the inner workings of your fading innocence. The lighting plays a 
factor too which emphasizes the emotional upbringing of the performers. 
Little does the audience know that the announcer was acting as a sort of 
sentient being involuntarily provoking the audience with a simple metronome 
of a word, absolutely marvelous. The colors are in a way conveying the 
ideology of the two party system with an eager yet subtle take to it. The 
only other time I've been moved by such art was when I visited the gallery 
in a dirty alley way with a dead hobo that symbolized the tyrant rule of 
the street rats. Such beauty in this work 0/10 because art should never be
