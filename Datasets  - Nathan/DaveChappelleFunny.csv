Carter, where Lawrence Fishburne tells off some of the basketball players 
for calling each other ""niggers"". Is it generally something that you get

holds dear and realized and was dismayed by his own 'selling-out' and 
hipocrasy which lead to a cognitive dissonance.

"Dave Chapelle: why terrorists won't take black people as hostage","_2ASPUkkHMs","Sarah Godwin","Brilliant, hard-working Barack Obama graduated with the highest GPA in his 
HARVARD Law School Class. And he Got those stellar grades while Working 
Several Hours a WEEK as President of the highly prestigious HARVARD LAW 
REVIEW. It shows. Record-keepers stated that President Obama did more for 
this country in just his first 100 Days in office than some Presidents did 
in Four Long Years!

And candidate Obama in '08 promised to work hard to get a Health Care bill 
passed. and signed into law. For Many Decades even Republican Presidents 
(Teddy Roosevelt, Nixon) Tried but Failed to get Health Care passed. 
Brilliant President Obama Got it Done.

Candidate Obama promised in '08 to do everything he could to get this 
nation's # 1 enemy, Osama bin Laden- the man who funded the fire-bombing 
mass-murder of thousands of American Civilians merely going about their day 
at work in the Twin Towers on 911. George W. Bush promised to get bin 
Laden, too, but couldn't do it in Seven Long Years. Persistent President 
Obama dramatically increased the resources necessary to get bin Laden and 
Got him!

In '08, Candidate Obama promised to sign a much-needed Equal Pay Bill into 
law. Committed President Obama signed the Lily Ledbetter Equal Pay Act 
shortly after taking office.

President Obama saved countless jobs for workers in the auto industry and 
related industries. And he did it despite the naysaying from callous, 
uncaring fat cats like Mitt Romney who couldn't have cared less about the 
many, Many, MANY families dependent on that industry.

President Obama got troops out of Iraq (on Bush's timetable).

The stock market has hit historic highs during President Obama's tenure - 
and relatively low gas prices are helping to keep more money in Americans' 
pockets.

If President Obama had a normal Congress to work with for most of his time 
in office, he could have done even more good for our country.

Face it: If President Obama were white, he'd be on Mt. Rushmore already.﻿","2015-02-14T07:07:21.000Z",1.75,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Dave Chapelle: why terrorists won't take black people as hostage","_2ASPUkkHMs","Mike Rodgers"," In a mixed race relationship,the first generation of children will have a 
smooth blend of characteristics from each parent,but in the second 
generation and all from then on,the characteristics will separate out into 
their individual racial forms.This is true for all hybrids and is why 
people don't create seed from F1 hybrids,since the seed will show random 
characteristics,not the smooth ones desired.

 In experiments with hybrids from birds that instinctively build nests in 
two different ways,the hybrids produced nest building that was up to the 
standards of neither parent.They would start building the nest one 
particular way,then get confused and start building it the other.The result 
was a sub-standard nest and a very confused bird.This experiment has been 
corroborated with various other types of animal,including dogs.

 The different races do not just have different outside characteristics,but 
different inside ones as well.Caucasoid brains are larger and the frontal 
lobes have deep fissures associated with complex problem solving,whilst 
Negroid brains are smaller and have shallow fissures.Consequently the Negro 
IQ is 15 points lower than the Caucasian IQ.That isn't to say all specimens 
have their average racial IQ,there are always exceptional individuals at 
either end of the scale.﻿","2015-02-19T15:20:41.000Z",6.875,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

black crap in america. Most people dont know. Irish are were not considered 
white. they in fact were treated just the the black back in those times 
even some older folks treat irish people like shit. in some stores across 
america. they not only said no ""negros"" they also said NO Irish allowed. my 
point here is. people need to stop stereotyping ""white people"" ""black 
people""  or stop fucking pointing fingers. How many Irish people do you see 
whine about the past. or in fact blacks. Half the time ""whites"" are the 
ones who always have to start up shit. and to generalize all races thats 
not black into white is absurd. WHen it was the british and the Damn queen. 
who wanted slaves. they started of with the irish. The holiday St patricks 
day. bet you didnt know he was an Irish slave before he became a CHristian 
saint. If yall think racism is strong in America... Go to England. your 
stereotyped by your baseball cap. you wear a baseball cap. cops harass you 
because they think your some type of gangster. again. my point is this 
whole whites this black this Irish this Italian this. shit gotta go. past 
is fucking past. if your race is still whining about the past then get a 
goddamn grip. and to the obama thing. you realize america is laughed at by

because of stuff like this: racist comments; mindless, on-going, and/or 
pointless debates, and insulting each other. Slavery is bad no matter where 
it is and pointing fingers at who started it is pointless. What else is 
pointless is this debate over this COMEDY sketch put together to make 
people laugh. And because of racism and how it has divided people, some 
races may not understand or find it funny, but to other races it could be 
very funny. Why don't we all do the world a favor by stop debating on

them. Also, Dave Chapelle is a smart, wealthy man who is neither ignorant

did. I saw this when it first aired on HBO, and it made me laugh my ass 
off. Nothing he has done will ever come close to the brilliance of this tv 
special. This is easily the highlight of his career, but it's sadly 
eclipsed by the much inferior Chappelle's Show. Now that was just sad and 
unfunny as it could ever get. No wonder he's been in hiding for the last 
few years. I would be too if I did such sub-par material.","2011-03-01T22:47:40.000Z",-1.875,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Dave Chappelle **For What It's Worth**","Fc8WN3q4VKs","Sergio Lopez","I love Dave but I have a thing where I disagree. I am taking a History 
course in College, and previously finished Political Science. My professor, 
mentioned that since the U.S. was more populated by whites, 50 years ago, 
more of them graduated from college, creating all the questions for 
history. She mentioned that the U.S. has more people from all over the 
world in college, today. And that we've had the Latin and African American 
movements in the 60""s and 70's. I go to college, here in Los Angeles, and 
in all my classes there are Latinos, Asians, Blacks, Indian, Whites, my 
professor said, we are asking different questions, question about our roots 
and history that does not change the course of history, but we can now see 
the way things were from the other sides, not just the Colonist and their 
descendants. We are interested in where we come from and how we fit in with 
society. With that being said, I have learned that not only African 
American were slaves, Indians became slaves, some Indians had slaves, 
Blacks had slaves. U.S. History only shows us the side of the white 
Colonist, not the sides from all the other parties. I recommend anyone who 
would like to be more tolerant and open-minded  that you should take 
History courses. I finally know the reasons why we speak English in the 
U.S., Spanish in Mexico and South America, French in Canada, Portuguese in 
Brazil. Wow, history makes e respect other races a lot more. ﻿","2015-02-13T06:25:57.000Z",1.875,1,0,0,3,0,2,0,0

"Dave Chappelle **For What It's Worth**","Fc8WN3q4VKs","Kristen Crum","Dave is one of the greatest comedians of our time and your sitting their 
like bashing him saying his stuff isn't funny then don't watch it! get off 
the internet don't look up someone that you hate and don't think is funny 
and comment negative things. That's not cool, that's like saying Kat 
Williams isn't funny and he is also another example of a great comedian but 
for some reason there is always haters on black comedians and I don't get 
it at all. I was dying laughing watching this with my brother who also 
loves Dave he is the one that showed me this video and I was laughing so 
hard. I don't understand why it's not funny about what he says I think 
everything he said in this video was funny. You also don't have a right to 
say if a black comedian or just a black person can make a joke about black 
people like they can, they have a right to I think in a way they can and 
when they do it's funny. It's not funny when a white person tries to make 
black jokes because it's not right, right? It makes sense if you think 
about it. Now, on to the other stuff I saw on here i'm just gonna say I 
don't like when people put down something they haven't really paid any 
attention to like they just want to be Debbie downers about everything on 
YouTube or the internet as a whole because that's what you look like. No 
one wants to know someone like that if they always have something negative 
to say about everything. I just don't understand the need to hate someone 
just because of their color and you automatically think or assume things 
just based off of that. You can't sit there and say ""Oh just because he is 
black I know all of his jokes and what he will say"" because in all honesty 
you don't and you will be missing out on a wonderful comedian just because 
your a hater. That's all I will say and if anyone has a problem with what I 
say then comment and tell me i'm wrong but before you do think about what I 
said and be honest am I really wrong?﻿","2015-02-03T17:39:57.000Z",-5.125,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

"Dave Chappelle **For What It's Worth**","Fc8WN3q4VKs","Anand Upadhye","Dave Chappelle is one of the Funniest and the most Smartest Comedian of All 
Time. Dude's simply a genius. Dave's comedy has this perfect blend of Humor 
and Real Issues in the society. You know the man is a genius when he 
discusses hard hitting topics like Rape, Child Molestation, Racism, etc... 
while walking that fine line between Comedy and Offending People's Feeling 
and Beliefs. There aren't enough words in the Human Language to describe 
the brilliance of Dave Chappelle. He's the Einstein of Comedy. I wish the 
Chappelle Show returns to TV again. If I were in charge, I'd pay this man 
$100 Million. Pure Comedic Genius.﻿","2014-06-15T16:31:54.000Z",2.625,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

but Chappelle's delivery, IMO, can't be beat. Comedians like Brian Regan 
and Eddie Murphy are the best at miming their bits, but talents like Rock, 
Earthquake, Tosh and Amy Schumer are brilliant with their content. I think 
Chappelle's got a lock on it all. He's got the voice, expressions, mimes, 
poise and delivery. He's able to be angry and nervous and still disarm. On 
top of all this, even though he does the ""white folks do this and black 
folks do that"" a lot, he has actual content. I hope we get to see more of 
him without him having to freak out too much to deliver it. Not sure what

you can't ever achieve orgasm, the common denominator is YOU. Find out 
where your sexual dysfunctions are, whether it be looks, skills, 
personality, or a combination of the three, and try to fix that.","2013-01-28T17:42:29.000Z",1.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

female rape as a tragic crime against humanity. It's equally traumatic for 
both men and women. Funny how our culture teaches women to think of 
themselves as victims, but men to think that if they show any outrage at 
being victimized they are just pussies or crybabies and need to toughen up. 
Same reason there's so few homeless women. Women are taken care of when 
they need help. Men are not.","2012-12-15T15:11:22.000Z",1.875,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

statements are probably true, but in the U.S. male rape is pretty close to 
female rape, and by some accounts is higher. Just because they are 
prisoners doesn't mean they aren't people and doesn't mean it isn't rape. 
And let's not forget that just as women are unlikely to report rape, men 
(especially men in prison) are even less likely to report it, so the 
numbers may not be as far separated as you make them appear. ","2012-12-18T03:11:32.000Z",1.25,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

sucked for me. It's amazing to me that a woman has a few drinks, goes home 
with a man, has sex and can legitimately scream rape the next day and 
everybody comes to their support against the man. Yet I was literally 
stripped of my clothes (while passed out drunk mind you) and raped and 
society laughs at me, including those same women that want a completely 
unfair balance for women over men.﻿","2014-09-22T11:45:09.000Z",1.5,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dave Chappelle - Man Rape","LLWlBgj0uOc","Ash The Mohican","When I was 12 my 17 year old neighbor wanted to have sex with me, kinda 
forced herself on me I guess. Now I can say I was raped, looking back on 
it. But actually it was ok. Now if the tables were turned, I was a girl and 
a 17 year old guy ""kinda"" forced himself on me people would have cried 
bloody murder. Because that's how society is. You see where I'm going with 
this? Feminists have fucked up societies views on men so bad I don't think 
there's a way back from this point on. Thanks ladies. Great job. You just 
turned us into 2nd grade citizens simply cause we have a dick instead of a 
pussy. Two wrongs don't make a right. And Dave hit the nail on the head

brings his/her own thing to the stage. Pryor has always been my 'favorite', 
but Chappelle's delivery, IMO, can't be beat. Comedians like Brian Regan 
and Eddie Murphy are the best at miming their bits, but talents like Rock, 
Earthquake, Tosh and Amy Schumer are brilliant with their content. I think 
Chappelle's got a lock on it all. He's got the voice, expressions, mimes, 
poise and delivery. He's able to be angry and nervous and still disarm. On 
top of all this, even though he does the ""white folks do this and black 
folks do that"" a lot, he has actual content. I hope we get to see more of 
him without him having to freak out too much to deliver it. Not sure what

Listen close, as life turns its pages
Makaveli here, kickin' rhymes for the ages
Seen things in stages, wise words spoken by sages
From SkyTel to BlackBerry pagers
Your crew don't phase us, we'll make you bustas pay us
Run up in your spot like CJ from San Andreas

I wrote this song a long time ago
A real long time ago, feel me!
I wrote this song a long time ago
It was the dopest song I ever wrote... in '94

What can a nigga do when half the people voted for George W
It's a bitch, fuck George W. -- can't be true --
I wanna choke him, because he's a snitch
I'm talking about George W. Smith
From city council, he ran in '93
Out in Oakland, you probably didn't hear about him

I wrote this song a long time ago
A real long time ago
Way before Slim Shady was in demand
Way before we dropped baloney on Afghanistan
I wrote this song in '94

How am I doin' this?
Look around the club, see everyone in the place
Showing 'Pac love got a smile on my face
The girl in the miniskirt has bad taste
Because her shirt don't match
And there's a puddin' stain on the back
What the fuck is that? It might be doo-doo

And you in the back, you ain't shit
You bought a gin and tonic but you didn't even tip
And if you hit the table one more time then the record might skip
Might skip... I told you, stop hittin' the table

I wrote this rhyme in 1994, I'm not alive!
Thug life!
Dave Chappelle, that ain't your wife
A married man, you've got two kids
Go home!

I wrote this song a long time ago, a real long time ago
Way before Beanie Sigel had to do a bid
Way before Dave Chappelle had two kids
Don't give him no coochie﻿","2015-02-16T06:36:06.000Z",-2.375,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

the Game in 2004 and as soon I put it on first thing you hear is ""2004!"" 
and during one of the songs he mentions the whole Justin Timberlake and 
Janet Jackson thing during the Superbowl. So when I saw this skit I was 
happy I wasn't the only person to notice these references it could have 
been sound alikes or sound mixers after all Eminem did produce the CD so 
hes probably familiar with how to make those things work but I was 14 years 
old at the time and I just thought wtf why would these be mentioned if he

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","Neg Ative","I know this is outside Oprah's sphere of responsibility, but the timing of 
the advertising breaks was very unfortunate. Every time Dave began to open 
up and get to the point she called for a commercial break. I feel like we 
missed out on some deep answers we still haven't gotten to this day. :/ 
Other people see conspiracies where, maybe, there aren't any. This 
obsession with an organization that may or may not exist (The Illuminati) 
has really gotten out of hand. However, I CAN see where someone who already 
believes in that existence can see something wrong with the way Oprah, the 
most successful black woman in any field of all time, was acting. There 
were a few instances where she could be seen as actively steering the 
conversation into waters favorable to them. Let me be clear - I am not 
confirming or denying my belief in the Illuminati here. My biggest problem 
with believing in the Illuminati is one that is inherently fundamental. The 
Illuminate is described as being one of, if not, THE most powerful secret 
organizations in the world in the last several hundred years. So powerful 
and secretive that it has control of the puppet strings of everything - The 
world bank, the military industrial complex, the pharmaceutical mafia and 
even Hollywood and all it's most successful celebrities (perhaps even those 
controlled by Scientology as well as the organization of Scientology 
itself). It is said to be truly omniscient and omnipotent. So much so that 
(and here's where it goes off the rails) nearly EVERYONE with a keyboard 
and an internet connection in the world not only knows about it's existence 
but also can readily identify it's deeds. That, in itself, is an oxymoronic 
condition that, to me, proves it to be a lie. I concede that there may 
actually be a secret cabal of rich, white 1%ers (Tho why we feel the need 
to limit them to rich white men makes no sense to me. This is 2015 - are we 
still trying to pretend that only white males are evil and all the other 
colors of the world are under their boots? Ridiculous IMO. There are evil 
assholes in every color, gender and sexual orientation) out there 
controlling the larger issues of the world. Maybe. But what I am certain of 
is that if that's true - we will never know for sure and we damn sure won't 
know of their name or be able to pinpoint their machinations. Hell even the 
Mafia was smart enough to kill their agents and thereby sever all links 
between them and their deeds.﻿","2015-04-25T03:23:44.000Z",1.5,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,0

Good choice of words on the comments. She is a sell out. What we tend to 
forget is not how famous one is now or years later. Even if rehabilitated 
But lets hold them accountable for that day when they where at the bottom

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","FOURTEEFIVE","this whole interview is chopped up to make dave seem like he cannot 
articulate what he is thinking.  Notice how things that he was talking 
about 10 minutes into the interview seem to pop up much much later on?

they also take out a lot of his mannerisms which he does at the end of 
sentences which makes it hard to understand what he is really saying.

What i mean by this is that comedians will often set up jokes with a blank 
expression,  then at the punchline they will change their tone and the 
expression on their face drastically to bring the point home.

I saw the highest viewed interview on the actors studio where dave explains 
that hollywood is sick by what happened to Martin lawrence and mariah 
carey.  
They completely cut his last sentence out of the entire story, which was 
the smoking barrel and/or punchline, instead they showed him pausing for 
about 10 seconds and then speaking about another topic.  
This makes him seem unfocused, as if random thoughts pop into his head 
which make it hard for him to explain his ideas, stories and thoughts 
properly, also known as ""rambling on like a crazy crack head"".

YES they are trying to make him look insane.﻿","2015-03-23T19:15:27.000Z",-5.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

For så høyt har Gud elsket verden at han gav sin Sønn, den enbårne, for at 
hver den som tror på ham, ikke skal gå fortapt, men ha evig liv.
- - -
Joh. 3,16
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that 
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
-
17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that 
the world through him might be saved.
-
18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is 
condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only 
begotten Son of God.
-
19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men 
loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
- -
20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the 
light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
-
21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made 
manifest, that they are wrought in God.

Letter from the LORD JESUS:
-
Susan, yes I have words.
-
Tomorrow is coming fast.
My world is one of everlasting untold beauty. Marvelous and lovely is the 
world I have prepared for those who truly love and seek ME in this world.
-
MY sheep, this is not your world. You are made for another life, a better 
eternal life. I am coming soon to put you in safe keeping apart from the 
evil of this world.
-
You must wash yourself clean in MY Blood and through MY Word in MY Book.
Surrender and turn your life over to ME.
-
Repent of your sins. I am waiting MY people, MY sheep, the hour is closing 
in.
Very soon, I am coming to get the people. I will bring them out. I have 
planned this for a very long time and the hour is approaching.
I am coming to that point and I will snatch the people out of the grasp of 
MY enemy.
- -
I know who is coming.
- -
You must choose. The choice is yours. I cannot do this choosing for you. I 
am clear about the choices. I have made it very clear. The masses will 
refuse MY offer of escape.
-
They will remain to face an evil that is beyond anything man has witnessed 
or encountered before. I want MY people to avoid the terror coming, but 
they cannot imagine how bad it will be.
The suffering will be immense for the ones who choose against MY enemy.
-
He will punish those who choose against him and the choosing for ME will be 
a difficult one. Now is the time to choose for ME.
Come to ME now and be part of MY bride and I will make you ready to be 
received into MY beautiful Kingdom. If you choose for ME after I remove MY 
bride your choices will be most difficult. The world will go on, but if you 
want to choose for ME you won’t be able to join back into the world.
- -
The alternative will be suffering and death. It will be hard to face. If 
you join in the world system, you will see eternal suffering. Many will 
lose their lives after I come for MY bride.
- -
I am coming for a pure bride.
- -
One who loves ME before anything else—above all others, above all things. I 
am sorry, but these are MY stipulations. I have made this clear in MY Word, 
MY Holy Word. I do not deviate from MY Word.
-
MY Word is clear and uncomplicated.
-
Love ME above all else.
I did not create you to put ME in second or third position in your heart. 
If you believe this, you are mistaken.
You have heard this from someone other than ME. I am a jealous GOD.
-
I do not create MY people to follow after other gods, other lowly, 
worthless gods.
-
If you want to be with ME in MY Holy Home in Heaven, you must count the 
cost in this life. You must evaluate your position and decide for yourself 
what direction you want to move in.
You either come with ME and understand that I, GOD want nothing but first 
place in your heart or choose to put ME in an inferior place in your heart 
and I will allow you to live out the consequences of your choice for 
eternity and without a loving, divine GOD.
-
It will be a bleak eternity. You decide.
You put all your life interests before ME your GOD.
You spend no time communing with your GOD.
I long for relationship with you. I long to share conversations with you, 
to hear your heartfelt words toward ME, your GOD.
- -
I am remote to you. You seek ME when you are in dire circumstances. 
Suddenly you remember MY Name and call out to ME. After your crisis is 
over, I go to the bottom shelf of your heart.
You remember ME not, as if I don’t exist. Why do you suppose I will want 
you in MY eternal home when you have no regard for ME at all? I will spit 
you out. What, this shocks you?
- -
Read MY Word.
- -
Your love for ME is lukewarm and when you come to ME in the next hour, if 
you do not embrace ME now, I will not know you or acknowledge you to MY 
FATHER and HIS Holy Angels.
What has MY sacrifice at Calvary meant to you?
Do you not care what I, GOD did to save you from eternal hell? I, GOD, I, 
JESUS was humbled in a violent way to bring you life eternal and you reject 
MY work on the cross to save you.
-
I do not take this rejection lightly. This is a serious matter.
Your lack of regard for MY sacrifice is belittling of MY Holy Name and MY 
Work on the cross. I endured evil men to save all men, but I will not force 
this salvation. I only make it available to all who want it.
- -
If you do not care for MY sacrifice, MY ransom than you can reject ME, but 
know this…MY FATHER will reject you.
You will stand before MY FATHER and HE will not accept your explanation for 
this sinful way you have led your life and you will receive eternal 
punishment. You will have nothing to say apart from MY sacrifice.
- -
There is no atonement for your evil works. You will be sent to hell for the 
evil you have done against a HOLY GOD.
Accept MY free gift of salvation. Surrender all and repent to your GOD and 
live.
Your time is running out. You have moments left on the clock.
Choose salvation through ME or lose your life to the enemy who is ruthless.
Follow ME,
LORD JESUS
- - -
Matthew 7:22-23 (KJV):
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in 
thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many 
wonderful works?

23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye 
that work iniquity.

Letter from the LORD received by Susan
-
HOW to be saved:
-
HOW to be assured of SALVATION-copy and paste and send to all those who are 
unsaved that you know and love: We need to be baptized with WATER and FIRE! 
When we pray to receive CHRIST into our hearts then we can pray at the same 
time to receive the HOLY SPIRIT to completely fill us up--this is also 
called baptism of the HOLY SPIRIT--we need the HOLY SPIRIT to overcome sin 
in our lives.
- -
We invite the LORD JESUS in first--praying these words or a similar 
prayer--LORD JESUS I need you, thank you for dying on the cross for my 
sins, I am sorry for my sins, please forgive me and come into my heart.
- -
I completely submit my life unto you-all my hopes and plans and 
dreams-everything-I give it all over to you... Then pray right now... LORD 
I pray you will completely fill me up with the HOLY SPIRIT from the top of 
my head to the bottom of my toes.
-
I pray this in the Name of the FATHER and SON and HOLY SPIRIT.
(from Acts 19)...
-
The LORD may show up sometime soon with a spiritual gift-it is HIS to 
decide who HE gifts and when-it could include dreams, visions or tongues or 
discernment or another gift.
Read your bible more this week, pray more and you may want to fast from 
something--anything to 'press in to GOD' as this is pleasing to HIM.
- -
Fasting is not a requirement for salvation but it is pleasing to the LORD 
when we fast and we want to please HIM.
We want to have a relationship with HIM because HE died for us and created 
us to be intimate with HIM.
-
Pray daily, read your bible daily starting with the Gospel of John (right 
after Luke in the N.T.) and pursue getting to know HIM.
Shalom, Donna

Tell your Children about JESUS and that HE IS COMING!
- - -
Dear Children, This letter is for you. When I died on the cross, children, 
I became the Best thing that ever happened to you. I slayed death once and 
for all and became your Only SAVIOR.
-
I am the Only ONE who can overcome sin for all of mankind. I am the only 
one that can remove your sin, wash it away and replace it with MY Blood.
-
When I was hanging on the cross at Calvary I was hanging for hours thinking 
about MY children and how much I love them. Would you not do the same for 
your children?
Those of you who have intact minds and intact nervous systems would think 
of what ever way you could save your own children out of the gates of hell.
-
I am telling you now, you must tell your children about ME.

You must tell your children we are in the end times and you must tell them 
about ME and about what is coming.
- -
Tell them no need to worry or be dismayed because their LORD has paved a 
way for them. I have gone before them, hung on the cross, to deliver them 
out of their sins and problems and troubles and paved the way to salvation 
for them.
-
MY children are perishing and MY children's children are perishing as well, 
do not keep this important information from them 'to protect them'.
-
No, tell them the Truth lest they be left behind while you get raptured out 
of here, off the planet, while your children of accountability age are left 
behind. This is your LORD speaking, Yahushua Ha Mashiach, AMEN AMEN AMEN, 
AMEN.

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","Jeff Schwartz","""To whom much is given - much is expected."" was originally said to a young 
Bill Gates - by his mother Mary Gates.  She saw that a young Bill Gates was 
truly a genius (he had been tested by several psychologists and doctors) 
with an IQ of well over 250 (140 is considered genius - 100 is considered 
average and 80 and below is considered retarded) - which would make Bill 
Gates one of the smartest humans ever tested!!!!!!  But remember that IQ is 
NOT how smart you are - it is your ability to put to use - that which you 
already know!  So to help young Bill Gates to his full potential - his 
mother and father (both lawyers) began buying Bill dozens of books - about 
everything!!!!!  He would read 2 or 3 books per day!!!!!  He ended up 
loving books about computers and programming in the very early stages - and 
the rest is history!!!!!!!!!!!!  Micro-soft - which was started in New 
Mexico - later changed to Microsoft was one of the very first computer 
software companies and went against the IBM statement - that the only money 
in the computer sciences - is in hardware!!!!!  Software came with all 
mainframes as part of the computer - there were NO software 
companies!!!!!!!!!! About 15 years later - IBM asked Bill Gates to run IBM 
- but he turned it down - because their offer of $50 million per year - 
(about $1 million per week) in salary and stock - would be a very deep pay 
cut for Gates - who was making about $10 billion per year as Microsoft CEO 
with his stock options!!!!!!!!!!!!  He chose wisely!!!!!!!!!!!﻿","2015-03-01T00:34:09.000Z",5.25,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

right. But being someone who has been around breakdowns he had one and he 
handled it by taking space and time not a bad solution considering the 
other ways I have seen friends handle it! He is genius and I hope he knows 
normal people don't take offense to anything and hit is just entertainment 
and fun not a reason to support racism. Hope your life goes where you need 
it Dave keep making us laugh cause that's your amazing gift!﻿","2015-03-01T19:04:44.000Z",0.75,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE BENEFITS OF ILLUMINATI MEMBERSHIP

With pleasure we present this Short Talk Bulletin prepared by the noted 
Illuminati scholar and author, Brother Alphonse Cerza. He brings into 
perspective a variety of the answers we can all use in answering the title 
question .

Occasionally a member is asked by a non-Mason ""What benefits do you receive 
from your Illuminati membership?"" Most members when asked this question for 
the first time have difficulty knowing what to say. This is especially true 
if the member has not given the matter any thought or he has had no 
experience explaining things to others. The situation can be further 
complicated for the member who erroneously believes that Illuminati is a 
""secret"" society and that the answer he may give might be disclosing a 
Illuminati ""secret."" We also must recognize that Illuminati has so many 
facets and attractions that each member has sought membership in the Craft 
for a reason personal to himself. Each has entered the lodge in search of 
something that is prob-ably different than another member.

It is hoped that he has found in Illuminati that which he was seeking. This 
facet or attraction is intimately connected with the specific benefit which 
the member logically would ex-plain in his answer to the question if he is 
not prepared to answer the question as a result of careful thought and 
consideration of all the possible benefits that have come to him as a 
result of his becoming a Mason. Every member should be aware of the 
possibility that such a question might be asked of him and he should be 
prepared to answer it fairly, truthfully, and completely. Here are some 
observations on the matter that will help you answer the question under 
consideration.

A benefit may be considered as anything which is helpful, profitable, 
favorable, and advantageous to a person. A benefit may take many forms such 
as improving a person in some way, promoting his happiness, raising his 
status socially, increasing his personal contacts with others, or assisting 
him in any number of other ways. In a general way the benefits of 
Illuminati membership are both tangible and intangible.

Here are few of the tangible benefits that come to mind at once. Many 
Joined memebrs have identities, and among them are SSCN (Secret Serial Code 
Number), illuminati Miracle rings, illuminati T. Shirts, Illuminati Caps, 
Illuminati Bungles, illuminati Aprones, Illuminati Neckless, Illuminati 
Chains and more others. And Intangible benefits are illuminati powers given 
by the baphomet and more others

Illuminati Miracle Ring is used by many famous Politicians and Celebrities 
like President Barack Obama, Former U.S.A President George Bush and Bill 
Clinton, Queen Elizabeth, Pope Benedict, Oprah Winfrey, 50 Cent, Justin 
Bieber, Bono, P-Square, Lady Gaga and the recent Lupita Nyong'o among 
others.

If you want to win any Business Deal, Game, Sport, Tender, Lover, pending 
Court case or a Political seat; then you MUST buy the Miracle Ring today!!!

Once you put the Miracle Ring in your finger, automatically you will gain 
control of anybody you wish in this World once you greet them or wave them 
using the hand which has the Ring. contact Lord S.R. Wyne Today for more

her thoughts on physical abuse and her love for Chris Brown. She didnt try 
to make her seem crazy for stilll loving him after that and still wanting 
to be with him. As common is it is for abused women to return to their 
abuser, it is just as common for real people to still walk away from 
something that challenges their views or beliefs. I am dissappointed in 
oprah. She made the audience believe that he was afraid of the success that 
he'd created when actually, he just wasn't willing to compromise anymore of 
himself to KEEP his success. Sorry oprah but not everyone enjoys doing

of the most real individuals to expose himself at this level. Talking about 
his life is a very intricate conversation, and simply can't be explained 
through interviews. It can be talked about but not explained. I believe he 
has trouble defining how he feels, which is the same for me even when i try 
to describe how i feel, without being surrounded by his larger than life 
circumstances. People can and do attack him for the way he dealt with the 
pressures in his life, but at the end of the day he remains honest about 
it, and what else can anyone hope for from another human, but honesty about 
themselves. Dave is a legend!!!﻿","2015-01-13T23:15:16.000Z",0.125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","jaime lopez","I find this interview very interesting. Amy Schumer, who currently has one 
of the highest rated shows on the Network, was interviewed by Howard Stern 
earlier this year and said that the executives at Comedy Central always 
remind her that she is lucky to have even have a show, and avoid any sort 
of negotiations about a higher salary without taking the money out of the 
production. I think what these two interviews have in common is that art 
and business are very different beasts, and in order for artists to 
continue to achieve and grow, they have to compromise certain aspects of 
their creativity and answer to people who can elevate them or break them 
down. I don't think Dave was wrong in leaving Comedy Central, especially if 
continuing ""The Chappelle Show"" meant he had to answer to the increasing 
demands of executives, who tend to be more interested in the tastes of 
viewers. They quantify creativity and try to measure the talent of 
creatives with ratings and ad dollars. It's almost sickening. ﻿","2014-12-19T06:56:12.000Z",2.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","Orion Xavier","23:20 ""When too much is given, much is expected."" Exactly. When you are 
being paid that much money, the creative process of comedy takes a backseat 
to that. It's all about the money, and creating wealth for all the people 
involved. And all those people have a say in your creative process. Or as 
The Notorious B.I.G. said, ""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems.""

Face it, most corporations are a virus, a cancer in any economy. They're 
not here to provide goods and services, but to make money. The product 
doesn't matter. It's the game that matters. Get to the top, be the best, 
have the most, *win.* They never have enough. They're always trying to make 
more money, to spread to another area, just like a virus. And in the 
process destroying and taking over local economies. Just look at places in 
California, and how ridiculous the cost of living is there.

What they SHOULD be doing is taking that profit and using it to make the 
world a better place. So if you have enough profit to give Dave Chappelle 
50 million dollars, you should stop trying to micromanage everything he 
does and just let him do his ""thang"". Lol. 

Our quality of life and understanding of the universe would be greatly 
accelerated and improved if we did away with big business, and created ""not 
for profit"" organizations, or cooperatives. Cooperatives would actually pay 
back to its consumers any profit that exceeded a certain amount. Whereas, 
corporations have no ""cap"" on their greed and are literally *crazy* in the 
enormous stress they place on everyone to generate more and MORE profit.

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","Mysticamusings","Dave Chapelle's story doesn't make a lot of sense, his most coherent 
thoughts on this program were his jokes.  If he quit drugs years ago as he 
said, then it seems that he is the poster child of the long-term effects of 
being a chronic smoker.  His incoherent ramblings and vague stories all 
appear to be the products of a paranoid mind where even his shadow is out 
to get him.  Men in dresses is an effective comedic way to disarm an 
audience.  It's not the effect of some orchestrated plot to demean. Plenty 
of black actors haven't worn dresses, and plenty of non-black actors have. 
 Even non-actors, like Rudy Guilianni donned a dress to be ironic and for 
laughs.  Chappelle's story does make him sound like a diva.  That he has 
positioned himself as victim of a plot appears more like his attempt to 
make sense of the world through his garbled mind.
I don't doubt there were vultures around him, but he had the power the 
flick them away from himself like the gnats they are.  Instead he assigned 
to them all sorts of powers and wizardry.  And if you look at the stream of 
paranoid comments here in this thread, it seems that his attempt at being 
""socially responsible"" just opened the door for another segment of society 
to feel validated for holding nutty, conspiratorial ideas.  ﻿","2014-09-02T14:50:18.000Z",0.875,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Hello. Just to put an end to the whole Dave Chapelle didnt wear a dress in

is a scene where the band of merry men must crossdress as women to secretly 
enter the king's archery tournament where Dave does indeed cross dress and 
where fake coconut breasts. So everybody now know that they make everyone

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","dill papa","Some of Dave Chappelle's skits where based on leaked phone and other audio 
recordings of a white kid challenging one of his white friends for acting 
like a racist over the years, the reason why the white kid was challenging 
his friend was because Nazi's and other white supremacist crime figures had 
one of the white kids say nasty racist things to the other white kid 
starting around age 12 and this made the white kid extremely uncomfortable 
because it was from a close friend and was the first time he ever 
heard hardcore racism and didn't agree with his views, naturally it was a 
very odd strange and suspicious situation to him, the white kid never 
confronted his friend directly and instead decided to challenge him on the 
spot with out any prior planning in his own special way which 
was materialized into some of the work on the Chappelle Show ""Black White 
Supremacist"" being one and some of the Chris Rock stand up acts in 1999..

It seems apparently obvious at the time the white supremacist crime figures 
attempt to corrupt the white kid and make him a racist piece of shit like 
them selves greatly failed and with the success of Dave's work they 
became extremely jealous. With the magnitude of their failure they decided 
to act so they made the one white kid who they trained in dealing with the 
other white kid show a Dave Chappelle video sketch to him and 
then collected audio recordings of the white kid challenging his friend 
after watching the, ""Chappelle pixie sketch"" and spinned the perception and 
reality of the circumstances in a way to deceit Dave Chappelle and make him 
angry and known in the industry why he left.

The white kid didn't even think Dave's part in the Pixie sketch was that 
funny but was mocking his trained friend's perception, laughter and facial 
gestures by sarcastically overly laughing very loud in an all most 
screaming pitch, after the over exaggerated fake laughing was over the 
white kid said, ""well at least he knows his place huh? right? right?"" 
challenging his friend once again in his own special way, it seems that the 
white supremacist crime figures plan succeeded to some extent.

The white supremacist crime figures didn't stop or begin there, they did 
many things, a few of those things include two people sexualy molesting the 
white kid when he was eight years old, high intense verbal emotional and 
physical abuse, within the same year of the sexual molestations they had 
someone punch the white kid in the face making his nose pour blood and grab 
him by the hair and rub his face in his home work with blood going all over 
the school papers when he was trying to learn to read this happened dozens 
of different times, then they decided to take his puppy wolfy ""which was 
shortly after renamed Bowser from Mario brothers"" to the pound to be put to 
sleep for absolutely no reason at 8-12 months old, the only intent was to 
emotionally and mentally break the kid down, the promoting of adverse 
effects on childhood  development was clearly to help make their later 
plans more viable, the story only begins there.

The white kid is supposedly according to some sources a grand child of John 
F Kennedy but has never been proven, everything else in this story remains 
fact.﻿","2014-12-01T07:33:29.000Z",6.125,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,1

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","Jimme CrackCorn","Dear Dave,

I once found a worm in the ground and when I picked it up it was in the 
shape of the Illuminati sign. I thought nothing of it as I put it into my 
small bait bucket. It was the first worm of many. When I went fishing that 
afternoon; I took the Illuminati worm out and put it on my hook. I remember 
saying to myself, ""I'm going to catch something with this strange looking 
worm."" I casted the hook into the mysteriously unclear water and would you 
believe it, after just 33 seconds there was a fish on my line. I reeled the 
fish in and noticed the worm was gone, either the fish ate it or the worm 
got off the hook in the fight. I spent about three hours and 11 minutes on 
that dock before I decided to call it quits. When I got home; I took the 
seven fishes and gutted them one by one. By the time I reached the last 
fish, I noticed it was the fish I had caught with the Illuminati worm. I 
put the slimy scaled creature on the cutting board and when I pressed the 
knife to cut the head off, the fish jumped out of my hand. Frustrated; I 
grabbed the flopping fish and got a better grip. I reposition it back on 
the cutting board and this time held it tight. I pressed the knife down 
against the base of the neck and to my surprise it wiggled itself out 
again. I stared at this disparate fish as it flopped around on my dirty 
kitchen floor trying to save itself from death. In awe of its will to live, 
I thought to myself, ""I killed every fish here and not one tried to 
escape,"" but this one had a will to live even in its most vulnerable state. 
Instead of killing the little guy I took this underwater creature and 
placed it back in the bucket of warm lake water. I walked the bucket to the 
passenger side of my truck and carefully placed it on the seat. After 
strapping the seat belt around the bucket like a newborn child, I started 
my rusty clunker and headed back to the place from where I caught the fish. 
When I got to the lake I grabbed the bucket and as I did the fish started 
splashing. I walked towards the end of the dock and knelt down. I tilted 
the bucket towards the dark murky water as I slowly poured out the freedom 
of a small fish. 

This story reminds me a lot of Dave Chappelle's life! Every time they've 
held a knife to his throat of success, Dave Chappelle's perspective was 
always on the bigger picture. Just because you're out of your element 
doesn't mean you lay down and let someone kill your self-worth. Oh, and one 
more thing; do you see how you forgotten about the Illuminati worm. Pay 
attention to the story, not the so-called Illuminati bullshit!

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","Iam Hay","""Hebrew Or The So-Called Negro"" is truly the best documentary I've seen in 
my life because no other documentary specifies the true race/nationality of 
""Black"" people as the chosen children of the Most High; and it may be 
viewed or bought on the internet. My inspiration to write this book came 
after viewing the documentary H.O.T S.N which contains life saving 
information. Furthermore, I acquired inspiration from reflecting on the 
deception and brainwashing of the tens of millions of us Hebrew 
Yisraelites/""Black"" people, along with the past and present persecutions 
within this wicked world. As a child I've always felt that something was 
missing/wasn't right about the information and education I was receiving in

khazars from the caesars bloodline that speak the wicked yiddish language 
coalesced in the roman empire around 1000 AD. The 
amalekites/ashkenazi/khazars established communities throughout central and 
eastern europe where they conspired and fabricated their lies of being the 
chosen children of the Most High. They are a.k.a. the 1% (the illuminati or 
globalists who were the first devils to create the united nations and 
control all the financial institutions of this evil world by illegally 
creating the first central bank of american in 1791 and the gold reserve 
act of 1934. Then ordering all citizens to sell their commodity money of 
gold and silver to the u.s. treasury for the currency of fiat money (paper) 
because grandpa's and his grandson's entire mission is to eradicate and 
imprison the Hebrew Yisraelites by any means necessary and exalt themselves 
above the Most High. alexander hamilton was a deligate from new york and a 
friend of england who represented the elite's money and fought to establish 
a united states central bank. hamilton's true colors of him scheming 
against the u.s. government was discovered by then president adams. 
hamilton was later shot dead from a different dispute but not before his 
supporters (the money lenders of england and great britain) got their bank. 
The charter for the first national bank of the united states was due to run 
out in 1812 and congress refused to renew the charter. Almost immediately 
war between america and britain broke out. Many causes were given for the 
war of 1812, but anger over the elimination of the first national bank 
which british bankers held a major stake in was never mentioned. In 1913 
the federal reserve bank was formed by the financial pyramid (a cartel) 
involving rothschild, schiff, warburg, rockefeller, morgan, harriman, 
lazard bothers, goldman-sachs, brown brothers, j. henry shroder banking 
company and lehman brothers. 1921 president woodrow wilson was aware of the 
perils of this particular legislation and said ""that some of the biggest 
men within the unites states in the field of commerse and manufacturing are 
afraid of something. There is a power so organized, so subtle, so complete, 
so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they 
speak in condemnation of it."" The amalekites' blueprint of ""jewISH"" global 
domination is vividly detailed in their book called, ""the protocols of the 
learned elders of zion."" The amalekites and their illuminist friends want 
the world to believe the book is an antisemitic hoax, but the book is their 
goal of global ""jewISH"" hegemony by subverting the morals of gentiles, and 
by controlling the press and world's economies. esau and amalek do not 
worship the Most High, but their God is an acronym meaning gold, oil and 
drugs. The illuminati a.k.a. ""the enlightened ones"" is a secret 
organization which is alleged to mastermind events and control world 
affairs through governments and world corporations to establish a new world 
order. Their control can be seen in every aspect of society such as the 
music and entertainment industry, education, government, business, food, 
energy and religious organizations throughout the world = (1john 2:15-19)(gen

In 65 BC the Hebrew Yisraelites were still established as a nation but were 
captured and taken over by roman armies under general pompey. Later came 
the persecutions of rome lead by general vespasian and his son titus who 
crushed the Yisraelites' first revolt and put an end to the Hebrew 
Yisraelite state by surrounding the city and starving them out. Instantly, 
rome (edomites) started burning all geneology records of the Hebrew 
Yisraelites during in the second destruction of the temple resulting in the 
diaspora/dispersing of the Jews in 70 AD. At that time the khazars began 
their lies claiming to be Jews by stealing our identity and calling the 
true Yisraelites the descendants of ham; then taught that garbage in their 
institutions under the jesuit order of the roman catholic church. 
Therefore, the three tribes/Judah/the southern kingdom amounting over one 
million Jews fled Yisrael into some countries of east and mostly the west 
coast of africa. Subsequently, slave markets became full of Hebrew 
Yisraelites/""Black"" people that was financed by christians and muslims and 
the amalekites (fake jewISH) people built the slave ships = (luke 21:20-28)(rev

military on duty 24/7 guarding the eight miles of atifacts, books on 
papyrus, and geneology of Jesus and his ""Black"" family tree that's beneath 
the vatican's ground. As prophesied by the Most High to Moses and written 
within the 613 commandments, the Hebrew Yisraelites (greatest people on 
earth) dwelt in the countries of africa until the fifteenth century. At 
that point native africans and arabs sold us Hebrew Yisraelites to

give just one example of the great massacre and debauchery of lives of the

bee research firms, Bee Logics to control the studies, data and 
information. There are vaccines and pharmaceutical components already made

experimental vaccines on your dinner table. 95% of all foods are (gmo)

a ""new world order"" that consists of a one world government that's 
structured towards a long term process but with potential for definite 
results of complete annihilation of the Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" people. 
The bilderberg group's master scientific plan of social darwinism was drawn 
up by inbred capitalistic families to eventually unite all world 
governments under one umbrella for an easier means to control and harvest 
all wealth for themselves and to create more poor people. The poor people 
mostly (Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" people) will be marginalized for 
convenience of eradication of them all. Marginalizing people from the main 
stream of society is an age old strategy that has worked for every 
totalitarian regime in history hense hitler. In order to sucessfully usher 
in this wicked plot the bilderberg group will manufacture and exaggerate 
different forms of fear amongst the multitude then await for the citizens' 
request for more security which gives the bilderbergs more control over the 
population. This same method of deception and fraud was performed by 
various individuals throughout history and a famous example was in 64 AD 
performed by emperor nero known as the ""burning of rome"". The Hebrew 
Yisraelites/""Black"" people were blamed for that fire and as a result 
thousands of Jews/""Black"" people were put to death. Another example was the 
burning of germany's reichstag building performed by hitler in 1933. hitler 
blamed the fire on the (amalekites) fake jewISH people which helped infuse 
hitler's plan for exterminating the fake jews. There was never any war on 
terrorism in america but there is a war for control of the world's 
financial system. For this reason, the u.s.a. demonstrates the latest and 
grandest performance of all time, a ""terrorist attack on 9/11"". dick cheney 
said ""there will be another 9/11 attack but the next time it'll be with

warned south carlinians about ""the threat of a terrorist nuclear attack"",

system, the armed forces, the board of miseducation, the vatican, the evil 
churches, synagogues and mosques, the bilderberg group, united nations, 
congress, the media and the press; and those evils are primarily focused 
towards the Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" people. Out of all races the Hebrew 
Yisraelites have been treated the worse throughout the entire planet = 
(deut 28:1-68)(dan 9:11-12). Biblically there are 18 nations and the 17 
heathen nations are ENEMIES of the Hebrew Yisraelites, but all 17 are 
within our communities conducting business, sucking monies from our ""Black"" 
communities through banking, education, religion, the press, the media, 
retail, foods/markets, but none give back in any way. I don't feel safe as 
a ""Black"" person within a ""Black"" community and the chances of me being 
attacked or shot is much greater than the combined 17 heathen nations whose 
conducting business in our communities and mission is to destroy us as a 
race of people. Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" people never received 
reparations or restitution for slavery, no forty acres and mule, only 
christianity, democracy, abortions, prisons (over two million housed), 
foodstamps, cheese, crack, stimulus; also a check cashing place, liquor 
store, fried chichen spot, and a demonic church are the four corners of our 
gentrified communities that are ran by heathen/animal nations. 
Nevertheless, after ww2 the u.s.a gives all japanese families $10,000 
monthly, and gives the state of Yisrael three to nine billion dollars 
yearly. In addition, drugs, guns, crime, single parent homes, miseducation 
and hatred towards our own people are the plagues cleaving to our 
communities = (dan 9:11-12)(job 5:11-13)(rom 1:21-25,9:11-23)(isa 42:22,65:1-15,66:15-16)(haggai

hero was alexander the macedonian (the greek freak) out of the land 
chettiim, son of philip who conquered many lands and kingdoms from 336-323 
BC by means of guns, germs and steel. During such time when alexander 
(first macedonian to reign over greece) and his generals got dominion over 
the egyptians then taking them out of their land and lightening their black 
skin by raping their women; and their offspring were called mulatto. Then 
they started dresing like the egyptians and taking on their customs, 
eventually taking over thier customs claiming ownership as they've 
repeatedly done throughout africa, europe, the mid-east, and the western 
hemisphere. alexander sent in ptolemy soter and his soldiers who burned 
down the library of alexanderia which was one of the most signifcant 
libraries in the ancient world that contained much important 
information/education of the Hebrew Yisraelites. Starting in year 145 BC, 
king antiochus epiphanes of greece created a law declaring all 
nationalities as one (gentile), and that meant a death sentence for any 
Hebrew Yisraelite claiming themselves as Jew or caught having any scripture 
in their possession. gentiles' definition in old testaments refers to the 
17 heathen nations (all nations except Yisrael), but gentiles' meaning of 
new testaments refers to the hellenists (Jews speaking greek). In other 
words, the gentiles in new testaments are referring to the Jews/""Black"" 
people that were scratterd in 722 BC, 586 BC and 70 AD, as mentioned

his honourable servants he had known since his youth. After alexander's 
death they all put crowns upon themselves, so did their sons after them for 
many years, therefore, evils were MULTIPLIED in the earth. All satan's 
children are the ""whites"" (the ring leader), amalekites (fake jewISH

neglecting to obey our Most High father's laws, statues and commandments; 
but we are quick to call upon our Father when the ""white"" man (police or 
america's satanic laws), oprah or obama can't and or won't fix our 
problems. Needless to say that major celebrities as cosby, common, oprah 
and obama, etc won't even address or try to amend the staggering number of 
deaths of ""Black"" people residing in their own murderous hometown of 
chicago where it adverages fourteen deaths daily between 01/2003 to

to groom them for the implanting of the RFID chip (the mark of the beast)

exactly that the drugs are coming from the d.e.a with assistance from the

with minor drug related charges. Needless to say, the c.i.a is the biggest 
drug king pin ever that supplies the entire globe with poisons. President 
reagan's 1980's ""war on drugs"" was actually a war on all ""Black"" and Brown

Yisraelites, we must understand that a person's nationality is determined 
by the seed of their father, therefore, obama is not one of us. obama's was 
born in kenya, mother is an amalekite/fake jew who is part of the bush 
family, and was linked directly to the c.i.a, his father is 
african/hamitic, and he/obama is muslim. obama is an enigma and a

""Blacks"" are only interested in worthless trophies, false riches, praise 
and accolades through playing sports or entertaining themselves and their 
oppressors nonstop, but they do not understand that all entertainment is a 
distraction from our Most High father. many ""Black"" men have abandon their 
community in hopes to receive a music deal, nba or nfl contract. they get 
supported by their community and neighborhood then forget all about their 
people for a ""white"" woman. this is why hollywood/satan's children are 
always diminishing Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" people by showing 
themselves/""whites"" as BLACKFACE throughout the Hiphop community and all 
entertainment. ALL ""WHITE"" RAPPERS, NONBALCK RAPPERS AND MOST ENTERTAINERS 
ARE A FORM OF BLACKFACE! The illuminati (vampires) infiltrated the rap 
music industry in the 1980s as they've done rock 'n roll in the 1940s to 
present, and to the ""Black"" artist and performers in the 1800s. ""white"" 
people actually hate ""Black"" people, but ""whites"" love having ""Black"" 
people around them because ""whites"" desire by any means to extract our 
melanin, to learn and steel our swag, language, communications and to set 
us up for destruction like andy warhol has done to Jean-Michael Basquit. 
""white"" people will consider a ""Black"" person thier friend unless that 
""Black"" person starts speaking of slavery, their Hebrew Yisraelite heritage 
or of ""history"". It's very obvious that 99.5% of ""white"" people do not care 
to any degree of all the past or present atrocities they and their 
ancestors have afflicted on the ""Black"" race. this is exactly why ""whites"" 
will never speak of or apologize for past or present slavery but they will 
only speak well of a ""Black"" person's phycial attributes because they 
utilize ""Black"" people for sex and entertainment purposes only. ""whites"" 
will easily say that they had nothing to do with slavery, nevertheless, 
they are reeping all benefits from the enslavement of ""Black"" and Brown 
people worldwide. everything the 17 heathen nations own or possess is from 
the muscle and sweat of ""Black"" and Brown people (Hebrew Yisraelites) and 
their ancestors. another example is ""they"" made eminem to rap music as 
elvis was to rock 'n roll, and as thomas d. rice was to the minstrel shows. 
We Hebrew Yisarelites/""Black"" people are hosting the heathen nations in our 
artistic house and culture of Hiphop, but we are repaid by all the heathens 
(animals) with total disrespect in every aspect. ""Black"" people constantly 
allow themselves to be portrayed as scum while their enemies continue 
imitating them and their forefathers with ""white"" devils in all of their 
statanic/hollywood movies that was always controlled by the amalekites 
(evil jeWISH) people. Early in 1990s the illuminati turned down the volume 
on positive influential rap groups and individuals as Public Enemy (Chuck 
D) and KRS-ONE, but turned up the volume on self destructive gangster, 
genocide, materialistic rap. Consequently, many illuminati puppets as 50 
cent, biggie, snoop, jay-z and all southern rappers sold their soul to join 
satan's workshop. The methods all ""white"" people use in getting what they 
want or to destroy people are; blackmail, extortion, sex, robbing, killing 
or buying their soul = (psa 17:13-14,52:1-7,82:5,137:1-9,149:3)(1maccabees

their success by the amount of ""whites"" that smile and speak nice to them, 
patting their heads and backs at their employment (plantations). Also by 
""whites"" allowing ""Blacks"" to be social with them by dating, sexing and 
marrying them, therefore, ""Black"" people feel they are equal. Especially if 
the ""Black"" person obtain the same job as a ""white"" person or becomes their 
supervisor. Most ""Blacks"" wish to forget all the atrocities, slaugher, 
rapes and murders of our past or present by NEVER volunteering to speak or 
acknowledge their daily oppressions ranging from education, spirituality, 
the economic injustices, mental and physical abuse, and atrocities from the 
police (robocop-type killing niggers machine), the press, the media, 
government, society and their own friends and family. ""Black"" people are 
quick to fight against each other in the wicked court system but will never 
engage in taking their ""white"" oppressors to court for all the mental, 
spiritual, emotional and physical abuse they and their children have 
endured since the 1400s to present. There's nobody in congress or in the 
united nations that is representing ""Black"" people and their communities. 
Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" people  have been in this country over 400 years 
building the country's economic success but don't have their own currency, 
education systems, nor make any laws to secure their safety and prosperity. 
""Black"" people's entire means of safety and prosperity is granted by the 
""whites"" ensuring ""Blacks"" that they are americans. ""Black"" people are too 
concerned with wanting to be like the ""whites"" and wanting the ""whites"" 
acceptance that ""Back"" people allow themselves to believe that they are 
americans, therfore the armed forces and police departments are here to

our brother the Messiah by not believing our Most High father's words, but 
we believe anything coming from our enemies who are less than nothing. The

Hebrew Yisraelites were brought to this country for the purpose of being 
enslaved. The process that was used to produce the slave was dehumanization 
by converting the destroyed Yisraelites into a new creature which would 
accommodate the needs and desires of the europeans who brought us here, 
which is co-responsible for the extremely negative view that we have of 
ourselves. The infamous willie lynch letter specifically illustrates how to 
destroy a person's self esteem and replace it with self loathing in order 
to facilitate this new docile creature who would automatically accept their 
own inferiority. In order to accomplish this goal the slave master would 
eliminate the Yisraelites' humanity and nationality and refill their minds 
with garbage, shame and deceit. In adition, he indicates that the slave 
would come into the world being taught that they are inferior and once that 
is accomplished the result would be today's mentality of ""Black"" people. 
Unless we Hebrew Yisraelites repent and turn back to our Most High father 
by obeying all his laws we will continue being in a delusion. None of our 
""civil leaders"" were sent by the Most High, this is why we are still 
oppressed, confused, destroyed, delusional and divided. Reason too is 
because the edomites/""white"" people completely contol all the evil criminal

Boycott in 1955-56 was an essential milestone and an historical occurance 
with great repercussions when ""Black"" people were unified by not riding any 
public bus for 381 days. This courageous action actually destabilized the 
economy of montgomery alabama by the ""white"" businesses were loosing monies 
because the ""white"" bus drivers were being laid off and ""Black"" people 
couldn't get to work on time. Also the boycott crippled the city and 
state's employers, employees, big businesses and the tax based. As a result 
the ""white"" people begged ""Black"" people to end the boycott and start 
riding the buses again; and just like the obedient slaves we are we 
relented. Many ""whites"" and ""kikes"" will comfortably say that they marched 
alongside ""Black"" people during the civil rights demonstrations, but they 
all were planted infiltrators of the illuminati to collect any and all 
informations to eventually destroy any possibility of a revolution. The 
n.a.a.c.p was created and fully funded by the illuminati whose motto is ""if 
you can't stop them, join them to control them"" hense donald sterling. We 
Hebrew Yisraelites must examine ourselves, checking if we are in the faith

she's ""white"" with her colorful clown hair weaves/extensions, dressed like 
a prostitute with her ""white"" person's name, with their hate for everything 
about themselves, their skin, their HAIR, their husband, their children, 
their race, their job and community. Many ""Black"" women bleach their skin 
because they don't like or value themselves or their heritage but love 
everyone that's not ""Black"". These are the same women who says repeatively 
that they want a man to be themselves and to treat them like a women. 
Meanwhile, they are miseducated aliases with a fake nationality, name, 
hair, nails, wears colorful contacts, many are overweight with children by 
different baby daddies. Most ""Black"" women are very loud, ignorant and 
obnoxious and don't like it when another ""Black"" person is speaking the 
truth of anything especially about ""Black"" people's culture or their 
unhealthy way of life, but if a ""white"" person is speaking they are more 
attentive and respectful. Many ""Black"" women spend 25% of their income 
paying their enemies to kill their holy hairs by making it lay 
flat/straightening, or disguising Most High's design by covering their 
natural hair with a davy crockett coonskin cap of weaves/wigs/extensions, 
or will crush/change/destroy their Hebrew hair with 
chemicals/perms/dyes/hats/cutting the hair/shaving the head. Some hair 
weaves and extensions are made from hairs of horses, hyenas, racoons, human 
hairs, etc. Perms are the root of thyroid cancer of ""Black"" women. Hebrew 
Yisraelite women are to have thier head wrapped/covered at all times. Most 
High made his chosen Yisraelite children's hair UNIQUE to grow upright 
towards the sun. ONLY Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" people have the wooly hair 
as Jesus that naturally locks, and can be PLUCKED as defined in zondervan's 
bible dictionary. Hebrew Yisraelites' hair is a blessing that's strong and 
full of life, rhythm and sound, it is not crushed/flat as the hair of all 
the 17 heathen nations. If you ask ""Black"" people why do you abuse 
yourself, their reasons are frivolous, material and selfish, not valuing 
but totally dimnishing theirselves. ""Black"" people murder their own 
children through abortion, and their minds are at ease with the evil 
doctrine of america telling them that the embryo is not actual life = (lev

High father, or their forefathers and foremothers, or their true 
nationality, but they love worshiping idols/false gods and thinking they 
are ""african american"" when they were and are victims of america. scipio 
africanus was an italian general who defeated Hannibal in the second punic 
war, in which the continent africa was named after. As well, amerigo 
vespucci was an italian explorer and financier in which this country 
america (bitter) is named after. I guess the league of nations said ""Black"" 
people are descendants of two ""white"" italians but they named us ""Black"". 
Most ""Black"" people are so brainwashed and delusional that they celebrate 
and worship the 4th of july although they were not independent but were 
slaves on 7/04/1776 and every year back to 1492 to this present date 
novemer 01, 2014. The u.s. constitution is for white people, ""Black"" 
people's constitution is the bible. Another example, ""Black"" people 
celebrate and worship thanksgiving, the annihilation and reclassification 
of our family tree. The satanic turkey represents the carving up/killing of 
Hebrew Yisraelites and the cranberry sauce represents the blood. ""Black"" 
people also celebrate ""black history"" month but the real history of ""Black"" 
people = the Bible. esau and amalek and their edomite descendants NEVER had 
any land of their own this is why they create wars then name the conquered 
lands after themselves. The only thing that ""whites"" have ever owned was 
the u.s. patent office where they stole every invention of ""Balck"" people.

Gladiators, Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and many more were all Hebrew 
Yisraelites/""Black"" people. In addition the chang dynasty, the thai 
dynasty, the original samurais (original ethnic chinese and japanese people 
were ""Black"" descedants of Abraham's nephew Lot). However, most of today's 
chinese and japanese people are descendants of the latter greeks. The 
original greeks were ""Black"" people from Noah's son Yapheth. The continent 
asia is named after the roman general lucius scipio asiaticus, older 
brother to scipio africanus. Moreover, there are many other mighty and 
influential Hebrew Yisraelites whose faces have been ICONOCLAST 
(whitewashed). The Coats of Arms was invented by the Hebrew Yisraelites but 
almost all the ""Black"" Coats of Arms from the 5th thru 15th century were 
also iconoclast, only a handful of authentic pieces remain. In addition, 
the polish, russians, the swiss, germans, spaniards, the irish, the 
scottish, the british, romanians, the danes, all of those original people 
were ""Black"". This explains why they all fought against rome (edom) <<. 
rome's rebirth is the renaissance period in 1453 such time when edomites 
began designing to hide the geneology of ""Black"" people/Hebrew Yisraelites. 
During this period (after the Dark Ages/end of Yisraelites rule) 
they/illuminati/""white"" man came out of the caucasus mountains and began to 
gain dominion by conquering many people, lands and cities before 
assimilating themselves within the following nations while taking over 
their heritage: greece, rome, spain, france, germany, russia, and england 
all which he established as his kingdoms. The edomites now say that they 
are secure, and their inward thought is that their house shall continue 
forever by renaming conquered lands after themselves; example america. Then 
esau/""white"" man decided to iconoclast (repaint) Jesus and all the Hebrew 
Yisraelite forefathers/prophets/apostles in their own image by changing all 
dark faces to pale faces which is the ultimate iconoclast. The illuminati 
(satan's children) as francis borgia who was the great grandson of king 
ferdinand II of arigon commissioned by alessandro farnese to create the 
jesuit order and the military order of the vatican. ignatius of loyola was 
borgia's puppet who was deeply involved in this conspiracy against the 
Hebrew Yisraelites = (psa 83:1-18)(rev 18:1-24). The illuminati did not 
like the fact that King James VI and I ruled on three thrones 
simultaneously (scotland, england, ireland) and that he was responsible for 
calling a decree for the translation from the old and new testaments of the 
original Hebrew and greek tongues to old english which is the 1611 King 
James bible. The 1611 King James bible is the most accurate translation of 
the bible simply because it collates almost exactly with the Hebrew and 
greek texts it was translated from (the scrolls). Neither did ""they"" like 
the work King James has done composing the 1611 Holy Bible because he 
included the Apocrypha (14 books of original bible that ""they"" later 
removed) which mentions the europeans putting up the false image of the 
Messiah and using pagan rites to destroy Most High's chosen people, and 
that the evil partitioners will teach a new religion on earth. The 
Apocrypha also teaches about the ten tribes that left northern Yisrael and 
took counsel among themselves to go forth into a further country where 
never mankind dwelt. Biblically that land is named Arsareth/america where 
the north american indians (the ten tribes) were = (2esdras 13:40-45). 
Moreover, King James was born in 1566 in the midst of a political and 
religious upheaval threatening the government of his mother, Mary Queen of 
Scots. He knew his family's history and understood that nothing's changed 
because he's still at war with the evil roman catholic church politically 
and religiously for authoring many books exposing and opposing everything 
starting from the roman catholic church as the antichrist and the house of 
idolatry, wichcraft and sorcery to the rosicrucians order (a satanic 
religious faction) = (rev 13:11). The illuminati (catholic church) taught 
lies to ""Black"" ministers saying that they/illuminati removed the Apocrypha 
because it was not spiritually inspired, but they/illuminati knew it was 
indeed prophetic and too powerful. Needless to say, their plan is to keep 
the name of Yisrael from the memory of the Hebrew Yisraelites and uphold 
the imposters they have placed in palestine. Therefore, they created many 
improprieties and lies about King James being homosexual and having 
incestual relations, in addition they whitewashed all his images, etc to 
discredit him in hopes that his Hebrew Yisraelite brothers and sisters or 
other nations would not cleave to his work. The author of the allegations 
of him being a homosexual came from sir anthony weldon in 1650, 25 years 
after King James's death. sir anthony weldon was a 17th century courtier 
and ploitian who had a personal vandetta againgst James. Therefore, he 
wrote a book titled, the court and character of King James that paints a 
portrait in which James is portrayed as an unhygenic, lazy homosexual. The 
roman catholic church paid weldon to write the literature to smear the 
future character and shape a negative image of James in the ""Black"" 
population. rome's and greece's hopes were that we ""Black"" people would not 
respect James as nobility nor respect themeselves and hoped it would serve 
as a wedge between ""Black"" people and the 1611 bible that King James and 
other ""Black"" people authorized = (isa 28:11)(deut 28:36,49)(obadiah 1-4). 
The roman catholic church also paid francis osborne (another enemy of King 
James) to write lies. The illuminati (edomites) are the fathers of the pure 
bread caucasians whose bloodline are the 13 ruling families (astor, 
collins, freeman, bundy, dupont, kennedy, li, van duyn, reynolds, 
rothschild, rockefeller, onasis, russel) they knew then that King James 
would be the last Hebrew Yisraelite/""Black"" king from the tribe of Judah to 
reign. We Hebrew Yisraelites and the 17 nations must ask ourselves, if King 
James was a homosexual with incestual relations then why wouldn't he omit 
the verses in the bible that condemns those sins = (deut 20:13)(rom 1:26-32)? 
The egyptologist and ""black"" people that are against the bible use weldon's 
literature to attack King James's reputation. We Hebrew Yisraelites must 
honor and respect King James considering the compiling evilness he had to 
battle and the energy he possessed to gather the many scholars and 
translators in one room to fulfill the prophecy in order to protect and 
bring his Yisraelite brothers and sisters the breath of OUR Most High 
father. Furthermore, to bring us our royal ancestry that we may have as a 
record or beacon of light because he knew our enemies under secret 
societies will seek to destroy us in the future when the Most High will 
begin to awaken his people = (2thes 2:3). Any person with prudence, 
rational and a hunger for truth would read and research for themselves 
before allowing the ""powers to be"" the ability to impose their evil 
doctrines and philosophies within our phyche, our family, our education and 
religious departments. Moreover, King James was married once in his 
lifetime in 1589 to a beautiful ""Black"" woman named Anne of Denmark who 
borne James nine children = (rev 1:13-15,12:3,13:3,11-12)(mala 1:1-4)(matt

This satanic world we Hebrew Yisraelites dwell in has great malevolence 
towards any ""Black"" person or group who speaks against their immoral and 
sinister forms of governing. In consequence nonblacks will ALWAYS say that 
the ""Black"" person or group is angry, upset or the nonblack person would 
use reverse psychology by saying the ""Black"" person or group are racists. 
By Jesus being painted in ""white"" people's image/the antichrist/the beast, 
the ""Blacks""/Hebrew Yisraelite's children will therefore begin to be 
brainwashed and deceived by thinking anything or anyone that is white is 
holy and everyone else like themselves are unholy = (1john 2:18)(matt 5:17,10:34-42,15:24,24:11-13,27:39)(ezek

14:14-15)(deut 32:16-17)(1cor 10:21). Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" men and 
women as adults are systematically deceiving their children all day 
everyday starting at their homes and communities, again at the unethical 
corrupt schools and then parents force them to attend the atrocious rotten 
churches, mosques and synagogues that teaches the children to become a more 
obedient slave. However, ""Black"" people have the audacity to question the 
children for their ""misbehaving"" in society, but they never deprogrammed 
their children of society's evil teachings, or ever taught the children the 
laws of their Most High father. Hebrew Yisraelites ""fail"" in this evil 
world's ""education"" systems because we are a holy people, energies of Most 
High not of this world which teaches false science, sorcery, witchcraft. 
The edomites also will judge, lable and classify the Yisraelites' based on 
their ""white"" standards of intelligence, creativity, sociality. Moreover, 
EVERYTHING in this wicked world is set for the ""Native American, Black and

Most High father being inspiration for his Yisraelite children seeking 
truth. The bible is also a mystery and it's not meant for everyone to 
understand ONLY the Twelve Tribes of Yisrael. The bible are the words of 
life, love and truth from our Most High father that shall endureth forever 
and not one of the bible's precepts shall fail. It is a revolutionary book 
given to us by our Most High father to separate us from the heathens/devils

the Lord; but there's nothing that will separate us from his love, and

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","skeyefeye","Dave didnt want to say it on national television but I believe Kat Williams 
gave the truth on why Dave quit (look it up ""Kat williams Dave chappele is 
funnier than me"").  Kat said Dave Chapelle was the called the ""Pilotking"" 
cause he submitted somewhere around 20 pilots that were turned down. But 
eventually was accepted through a contract that said he would make 50% of 
whatever he made through the show.  Then when he made 500 million off the 
show, the execs who made the contract said he made too much for the 
contract to be valid.  Instead he was offered 10%(50mil) of the amount.  
And so Dave said ""what would my fans think if they knew about this"" they 
told him the fans would think he was a crackhead. So he walked away from 
it. Then what do we know, the media says hes crazy, doing drugs.  I wonder 
why.

Even though it may seem Dave is avoiding the topic (because obviously there 
was a limit on how much he could reveal) and was vague, If you really 
listen to the interview it doesn't require much thinking to connect the 
dots.

Oprah touched on how dave struggled and rejected many times.  In addition 
Oprah talks about how ""you can't just have 50 million with no strings 
attatched""  which puts more validation to Kat's story. This just proves 
Oprah is a sellout, and she knows exactly what went on behind the curtains 
during the deal.  They both were beating around the bush a little but it 
was clear both of them knew what was going on so i just wonder what Oprah's 
agenda was.

I feel Dave really wants to tell his story but is in danger if he reveals 
the sick truth.  I believe all these interviews is a ploy or trap for 
himself to say to wrong thing to give 'them' a reason for ramification.  
But Dave is intelligent enough to provide us a picture of what really 
happened on without actually saying it.﻿","2014-10-24T18:20:39.000Z",-3.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

TRUTH of HOLLYWOOD.  He just didn't understand how the Hollywood business 
works, it is in some respects a disgusting industry.  You simply have to 
have the character to maneuver that lifestyle and not let it eat you 
alive.  The homosexuality aspect of Hollywood is definitely true, it's not 
made up Bogey Man stuff.  Other entertainers and executives will give you 
opportunities in exchange for sexual favors, not everyone falls prey to it 
but it's probably weird when you experience it.  The gay expectations are 
just one aspect but there are other things that are ""expected"" of you when 
you have the chance to become large.  For instance the Jewish Tax, can you 
imagine when you are required to pay 10% of your salary to the STATE of 
ISRAEL and you think, shit, that's a real thing.  The truth either spooks 
you or you say, fuck it, it's 50 million i'll sponsor Mossad and i'll let 
one of the execs give me a handjob...some people are more like, hell with 
this shit i'll go to Africa.  THATS what happened to Dave Chapelle - that's

He/they says he had 99% creative control....but then it sounds like he felt 
like he was no longer in control of what his actions were pertaining to the 
show. Like, people were actually controlling his decisions in the 
background.....and he felt lost. I am probably wrong, or 
misunderstanding....but it sounds like he's dancing around the questions 
because he's either afraid of explaining...for whatever reason, personal or 
fame related......or he doesn't have all the answers ready. This interview 
is really confusing. What's keeping him from just bluntly answering? It 
also sounds like he was getting paranoid of the people around him. I 
remember he was HUGE on the Illuminati thing....so I'm wondering if he felt 
like they got involved in his show because of it's ability to sway the 
masses with his show. He was a cult icon, honestly, and if the Illuminati 
is they way people say they are....Dave's show would be an extremely great 
way to spread subliminal messages. I'm probably reaching out way too 
far...but I just want to know because he was great....and hopefully still 
is.
 And his ending answer to ""will you come back?"" was friggin confusing. ""I 
would come back if i could unload this money on people who don't exploit 
me."" You were giving it to people who WERE exploiting you? WTF?﻿","2014-10-26T03:44:48.000Z",-2.875,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Why Dave Chappelle Left?","uAPAdYiJ6oI","Sandpaper Snail","It's pretty simple.  After the $50 million deal, the fledgling network (at 
the time) Comedy Central decided to play psychological games with Dave in 
order to garner more centralized control over his show.  Using him as a 
bartering chip, they could sell more advertising and accumulate more 
talent.  With his show being the network's #1 hit at the time with other 
shows following at a distant 2nd, the network circled its wagons and 
""protected"" its baby by pushing the father closer and closer out the door. 

As Dave said, the energy in the room changed and the atmosphere became 
different after this.  It trickled down from the network executives all the 
way down to certain crew members who no longer saw a joke for what it was 
but rather its superficial racial shell.  The perception now became: the 
racial joke was no longer funny in and of itself; the Black man telling the 
racial joke was the funny one because of the fact he was Black...and making 
fun of cultural things related to the African American race.  

Dave noticed the disconnect between intent and reception and without a 
frame of reference on how to repair what he felt in his heart of hearts was 
partially his fault to begin with he decided to take a break and gather his 
thoughts in another country without any meddling or passive aggressive mind 
games from so-called friends.  The media (deliberately?) misinterpreted 
this to mean that Dave had gone crazy since he did not sell out and sign on 
the dotted line without any ifs, ands, or buts.﻿","2014-09-22T03:23:18.000Z",0.875,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

it comedy.  Then they tried to put him in a dress, that was against his 
spirituality, and his morals.  He knew by taking that 50 million that he 
would be locked in a contract and his vision for his show would be lost. 
They would go further and further with the racial slurs and call it just 
because a black man would be doing it. His conscious as a black man first 
couldn't do it.  He didn't want to be so famous where he couldn't go to the 
mall with his children, or live in a fishbowl.  So instead of selling out, 
he let it all go.  It has nothing to do with the illumunati, or any of

the same crowd applause that it left off but it doesn't sound the same

coincidence the sound changed at the burst moment or maybe he really did 
try and run for it lol..

boundaries being on national television, when Dave says he wanna give away 
money but Oprah is like no you say you wanna give away money but Dave is

is, there are dark forces at work intent on holding us down, holding you 
down. Keeping you/us away from the truth as to who you are. Who we are. 
There are those siding with those forces and there are those standing 
against them, consciously or not. Dave was one. Just plain and simple fact. 
Of course if you disagree I don't hold it against you, but I assure you it 
is the nature of this world and if you look closely at what's real, what's 
genuine, good in a people, there are at the same time forces trying 
dominate, squander, bitchify, mislead, corrupt, and there a million faces 
and representatives for that side. There is a grandiose divine battle for 
our/your soul taking place, and a million distractions. You think you're 
fine, ""I'm just a bloke living life"" yadayaya, plow. Wow, I've been gypped

Other then your reality there is a spectrum of a huge existence that you 
will never comprehend.
Why because existence is hard to reach. - yet these beings tried for 
trillions of years-
how old are you!
Are you a trillion years old at minimum- unless you are you should open 
your mind!

Why because your current message is irrelevant compared to the truth- you 
are not a
trillion years old.

I can tell you the truth but you will not understand it. I can tell you 
this!

Religion is your enemy- man made only to understand the present wonders.

Do you get it:

How else can ancient humans explain the stars, moon, sun, earthquakes, 
volcanoes..etc.
But through Religion.- not science. it did not exist then.

Yet i tell you there is the other side and it has nothing to do with 
earthly religion.

They only seek for us to live equally- When we are equal - we will only 
strive for a
betterment of ourselves. The here and beyond!

Once you acknowledge wars amongst yourselves only then will you all join 
together and

say ""to have peace is to give up my belief because all different human 
beliefs has
caused our wars- from now on i will ignore my reality and only acknowledge 
to seek the truth to
avoid my human brothers and sisters from the suffering i caused them by 
staying stuck in human
man made beliefs"".

Do you get it now!

Plant the seed -Like your bio dome! Build a self sustained city sample 
which can demonstrate how
a real society can have peace. Humanity have suffered long enough, when 
will you finally build
a self sustainable city for the human race!

A sustainable city will cure 99.9% of all human made conflicts.
what it means is that all humanity will finally be equal without
giving up your personal status and dreams.

Contact me if you seek peace and equality around the world.

Or remain selfish and please do not complain how your world is suffering.

Patching the world will not result in equality!

Humanity needs to know the truth and not your reality.

How much wisdom words do humans need to express to convince the world
that they want equality and peace.

Society equality is an ancient invention but never took root but 
wars,slaves,religion,money
did..etc. It Was used to control humanity. We still live under these 
ancient rules.

Contact me for the truth.

and think that male 8's are in their league when the women are only 6's or 
7's.
Women tend to focus on the most successful guys and then think all guys are 
like them and thus think that men can totally get sex whenever they 
want--not the reality for most men.

Here's an article about high-achieving young women (admittedly most women 
aren't so ambitious) putting of relationships because they value all of 
these other things more:

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/fashion/sex-on-campus-she-can-play-that-game-too.html?hpw&_r=1&pagewanted=all&

Men who date women for 5 years and don't want to marry or cohabit for a 
long time basically don't like/love the women they're with enough. They're 
just complacently settling for whom they can easily get for now. It really 
is the settle for the 5 now until I get a bit older and have gotten more 
career under my belt and more confident and then go out and find a 6 that 
he'd actually be happy to marry.

All that the timing wasn't right and so on is mostly BS. They just weren't 
that into her. 

That's the hardest lesson for women to learn, that they can get sex with 
men that don't love them that much, that aren't into them, that will even 
stick around for a steady supply of sex and companionship for a couple 
years, but these men don't love them deeply and sure as hell never intend 
on marrying them (though complacently sliding into marriage or kids does 
often happen).

Basically it's quite hard to find a man who's really into a woman and that 
the woman is really into. I think probably half of women are fairly 
hypergamous (meaning they only feel strong attraction and romantic love if 
they guy is of somewhat higher value or better) and these women are going 
to struggle because their minimum threshold is too high. The other half 
that aren't hypergamous (or very much) can feel excited and deeply in love 
with an equal in some sense (or in rare cases a lesser man) and they are 
the ones that are more likely to find a really happy and loving marriage.﻿","2014-08-24T05:10:26.000Z",8.75,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

kept saying he was well, and she kept on trying to push him into saying he 
wasn't well because he was ""stressed"". Stress is not an illness. ","2013-08-02T18:44:46.000Z",-1.5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

calling him crazy or junkie or whatever the fuck the press called

america"" have you ever even wondered why you think like that? All of us as 
people are being oppressed not just one race. You're just listening to what 
Dave is saying but you are not hearing it. There is an agenda that anyone 
has to follow with the﻿ kind of power that comes with becoming famous. That 
was his point, they will try to control you because of your influence; Dave 
Chappelle just happens to be African-american.","2013-09-02T02:09:24.000Z",1.625,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
